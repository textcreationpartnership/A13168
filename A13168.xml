            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough, Sir, many of your good friends and folowers haue both long looked, and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to heare from you: yet, I doe aſſure my ſelfe, they looked for nothing leſſe then to receiue from you ſuch a ſlender and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling pamphlet as this, which goeth vnder the name of your apologie. they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted rather to ſee thoſe famous obſeruations of yours, which you haue written againſt the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon the new Teſtament, which they eſteeme ſo highly, or els ſome ſuch like notable learned, &amp; labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enemie. I, for my part, when I firſt heard, that your name was once againe come in print, and that ye had now at length broken your long kept ſilence, looked (at the leaſt) for ſome<note n="1" place="margin">Tanquam ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanti partum.</note> great and learned volume in defence of that cauſe, for which you haue ſo much practiſed, and ſo long and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently contended; and which you were wont ſo highly to magnifie. I did well remember how you promiſed, that <hi>for</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">In the front of his firſt reply.</note> 
               <hi>Syons ſake you would not holde your peace, nor for Hieruſalems ſake take any rest.</hi> as if this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your forged diſcipline were your onely <hi>Syon,</hi> and that holy <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> for which you contended. you tolde vs further, and that (I thinke) in very good ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>that</hi>
               <note n="3" place="margin">1. reply.</note> 
               <hi>if euery haire of your head were a life, you ought to afford them al for the defence of your cauſe.</hi> You affirmed
<pb facs="tcp:21141:3"/>alſo that your diſcipline<note n="1" place="margin">Preface 1. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> 
               <hi>is agreat part of the Goſpell:</hi> that it is <hi>a</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">1. and 2. reply.</note> 
               <hi>matter of faith, and an eſſentiall note of the Church:</hi> that the Church without it, is like a garden<note n="3" place="margin">Pref. 1. reply.</note> 
               <hi>without a hedge:</hi> nay finally<note n="4" place="margin">M. Cartwr. table.</note> 
               <hi>that it is Chriſtes kingdome vpon the earth.</hi> I could not therefore thinke otherwiſe, but that now you had vndertaken the defence and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that moſt glorious and neceſſary worke. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could I imagine, that<note n="5" place="margin">1. Theſſ. 2.</note> contrary to the Apoſtles example, <hi>you would ſeeke for glory at mens handes;</hi> or els like the princes of the Iewes,<note n="6" place="margin">Iohn 12.</note> 
               <hi>eſteeme more the praiſe of men, then the glory of God:</hi> and to come neerer you, that you would abandon the defence of your <hi>Syon,</hi> yea and of your <hi>holy citie Hieruſalem,</hi> and would ſuffer your hedge to go downe, and your Church to lye waſte, and plainely would renounce a great part of the Goſpell, and of your new faith, and all this to talke<note n="7" place="margin">The argument of M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights booke.</note> of the vſe of money, and purchaſes of land, and <hi>Hackets</hi> and <hi>Copin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> matters, and your owne fancifull opinions, and vaine praiſes.</p>
            <p>Yea, and all that haue heard of your fame, expected farre other matters, then this ſhort pamphlet like two ballades ſtitched together at your handes: and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected, but alſo deſired and wiſhed, that if needes you would take penne in hand, you would trauaile in your former cauſe, rather then in this priuate quarrell betwixt your ſelfe and me. and that alſo was my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire. not that I would haue that fire ſtirred, which once you had kindled, and is now either quenched or well couered; but that I hoped, that by your defence all men ſhould clearely ſee, firſt the nakedneſſe and weakeneſſe of your cauſe, which with no eloquent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you could couer, nor with pretence defend; and next, that the ſame is not ouerborne by authoritie, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21141:3"/>ſome beare men in hand, but reiected, repelled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, as a new forged deuiſe, repugnant to al antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to all iuſtice, to al reaſon, and trueth.</p>
            <p>As for this your apologie or briefe anſwere, as you call it, it ſatisfieth no mans expectation, or deſire, as I thinke. if you reſpect the principall cauſe; it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent, if you ſeeke to iuſtifie and cleare your ſelfe, you haue done iuſt nothing. that is apparent by theſe particulers. You deny, <hi>that you did execute any part of your brother</hi> Stubbes <hi>his last will.</hi> an vnkinde part (you muſt needes confeſſe) eſpecially if he requeſted you, or meant to put you in truſt. but what is that to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? that you haue dealt in the execution of my Lord of Leyceſters will concerning the ſtocke of his Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, you cannot deny. Likewiſe moſt apparent it is, that you haue dealt (how wel, I know not) in diuers other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil cauſes. which is ſufficient to make that cauſe good, for which I alledged that argument. You ſay alſo, <hi>that you haue not three or foure mannours;</hi> and percaſe you are ſorie for it. but what apperteineth that to your elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? I truſt you meane not, if you had them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey them ouer to ſome friends in truſt for maintenance of a learned miniſtery, for want of which your conſorts pretend to bee ſo much offended. Neither is the want of land or fee any blemiſh to your credit. for many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt, and learned men haue not ſo much as one quarter of your reuenues. you tell vs <hi>that you leant not 300. <hi>li.</hi> to</hi> Francis Michel, <hi>but only 200. pound.</hi> and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greatly material, whether it be. rather then you would looſe either 200. or one hundred pounds, you would percaſe wiſh you had neuer ſpoken worde for your conſiſtorie. you take it in euill part, that I ſhould cal the Hoſpital, whereof you are maſter, <hi>your Hoſpitall;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21141:4"/>and yet is the ſpeach common, and no harme meant, not is it any aduantage to your cauſe, whether it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my Lord of Leyceſters Hoſpital, or your hoſpitall. if ſo be you might haue had your fooliſh courſe, many learned men would not haue bene ſo wel mainteined, as the poore of your Hoſpital. Such like be your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, where you take your ſelfe charged to be a man that hath ſtrange conceites <hi>concerning extemporall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and working of miracles.</hi> neither of theſe matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to your conſiſtorial gouernment, nor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch you in reputation. Your acquaintance with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingers</hi> cauſes, and allowance of <hi>Martins</hi> libels, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, are foule matters, and touch you in your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet doe they concerne the conſiſtoriall cauſe, but litle.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, albeit your principall drift in this your apologie was to cleare your ſelfe of all notes of diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, and lewd opinions, and lewd practiſes; yet haue you done none of theſe. nay in thoſe matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <hi>Stubbs</hi> his will, the purchaſe of lands, and lending of money, wherin you ſeeme to haue moſt aduantage, you do but trifle. all this now I wil briefly note, but the proofes you ſhall ſee largely deduced in the diſcourſe enſuing. Firſt where I doe make diuers queſtions, and ſome that touch you very nerely, you paſſe the moſt of them ouer with ſilence. but if you would haue iuſtified your ſelfe, you ſhould haue anſwered them al, and that in direct and plaine termes. I<note n="1" place="margin">Anſwere to the petit. p. 186.</note> aske you whether <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> booke which he entitleth <hi>ſacram Theologiam,</hi> and which you ſeeme to allow, conteine not ſtrange diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and gladly would I know, if you miſlike any thing in that booke, what the points are you miſlike. you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere nothing. I<note n="2" place="margin">Ibid. p. 189.</note> demaund of you whether <hi>Barowes</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21141:4"/>concluſions doe not folow of your aſſertions. And what ſay you to it? forſooth nothing. I aske if the Prince refuſe to reforme the Church, how far inferior magiſtrates, and the people may proceed therein; and thereto your anſwere is<note n="1" place="margin">Ibid p. 194. &amp; 195.</note> ſilence. I demaund of you, if you and your conſorts do not thinke the practiſes of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> for the ſetting vp of their diſcipline lawfull, and worthy to be folowed: and to this you ſay<note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem p. 195.</note> nothing. I demaund further, whether you and your fellowes haue not aſſembled in ſynodes and conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and there decreed and enacted certeine Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical canons and rules, &amp; ſubſcribed and practſed them contrary to her Maieſties lawes, and the ſtatutes of the Realme: and you alſo anſwer, as to other matters. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be reſolued, whether you had diſgraced her Maieſties Eccleſiaſtical lawes, reformation, &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; you reſpect my deſires nothing. Diuers other matters likewiſe I demaunded of you, vnto which you anſwere nothing. nay in the matters concerning <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi> practiſe, and <hi>Martines</hi> libels, and her Maieſties ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, you anſwere imperfectly and vnſufficiently. you dare not ſet downe my whole queſtion, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe al was done concerning <hi>Copinger</hi> and <hi>Martin.</hi> nor wil you anſwere directly to thoſe particuler points of her Maieſties ſupremacie, which the ſtatutes and lawes giue her. and doe you thinke, that this kinde of anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is ſufficient to cleare you. Why, then let <hi>Sanders, Allen,</hi> and thoſe Papiſts and traitors which confeſſe ſo much in termes, as plainely and openly as you do as yet, be cleared. concerning <hi>Stubbs</hi> his wil, and your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Francis Michel,</hi> and others, you haue alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted my meaning, and altered my words, and maner of writing. who then ſeeth not how litle meanes you
<pb facs="tcp:21141:5"/>had to cleare your ſelfe, being put to theſe hard ſhifts, and not daring to ſet downe his words, whom you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to anſwere? but this we ſhall ſee more euidently when wee come to the examination of the particulers of your briefe.</p>
            <p>Further, your anſwer is altogether vnſufficient. you do ſtill cry out in your tragicall maner, <hi>ſlander, ſlander:</hi> and yet you doe not vnderſtand what is ſlander. you ought therefore to vnderſtand that ſlander is,<note n="1" place="margin">L. 1. ff. ad S. C. Turpil.</note> 
               <hi>when matters criminal are purpoſely, and falſly obiected.</hi> but thoſe things, of which you go about to purge your ſelfe, are either not criminal, or els moſt true, &amp; in part by your ſelfe confeſſed. your ſelfe confeſſe, that ſome things obiected to you are in their owne nature indifferent. how then are they ſlanderous? that you were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Hackets</hi> and <hi>Copingers</hi> practiſes, and diſliked not <hi>Martines</hi> courſes, ſhalbe proued. that you would not at the firſt anſwere to certaine points concerning the Queenes ſupreme authoritie in cauſes eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, you<note n="2" place="margin">In this booke and in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning that matter.</note> confeſſe. how then can you ſay, you are ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? becauſe forſooth, as you would inſinuate, you did afterwards acknowledge it, &amp; now offer to ſweare it. and yet you wil be taken halting, when you come to the particuler points of that authoritie. You deny that you allowed <hi>M.

               <hi>as refuſing</hi> Chriſt to reigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them; the preaching of the word, as not orderly; the adminiſtration of the Sacraments in this Church, as not pure nor ſincere? neither haue you ſo good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to charge me, as I haue to charge you with ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me, hauing without cauſe imputed this vnto mee, and charged me with ſhifting, and I know not what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian dealing, and hauing put foorth and excited your friend to raile on me, and charge me with diuers odious matters in the preface to your booke. matters, which I do the leſſe regard, for that as hee hath raſhly charged me; ſo he hath wickedly blaſphemed God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that God hath blaſted my penne with a lying ſpirit,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting therein the wicked act of lying to God himſelfe, which is the Spirit of trueth; and not only to me, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe my ſelfe to be ſubiect to many errors. of this, <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> me thinks, you ſhould haue had more care, and vſed therein more diligence, and not ſuffered ſuch blaſphemies to paſſe in the forefront of your booke.</p>
            <p>But, may you ſay, if you haue not ſlandered me; yet
<pb facs="tcp:21141:6"/>you haue wronged me. as if it were wrong to deale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the troubler of our peace, the chiefe authour of your ſchiſme, the diſturber &amp; ſlanderer of this Church and ſtate. and yet haue I done nothing otherwiſe, then beſeemed mee. In my firſt bookes I dealt with you no further, then the cauſe conſtreined me, &amp; your impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, that firſt began to oppugne the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked me. In my anſwere to a certaine petition in the behalfe of your ſelfe, and your ſide, I do confeſſe, I dealt with you more particulerly. but I was drawen to it by the authors odious queſtions and courſes. When the petitioner ſaid, <hi>Quaere of</hi> Matth. Sutcliffe, <hi>who is euer carping at M.</hi> Cartwrights <hi>purchaſes, why he may not ſel his fathers lands, and buy others with the money:</hi> how could I ſatisfie the man, vnleſſe I touched you particulerly. blame therefore him that began the braule, if you finde your ſelfe therewith agreeued; and not mee, that did nothing but defend my ſelfe, and anſwere.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of the harſhneſſe, and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your ſtile? your booke it ſelfe, albeit I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, will herein ſay ſufficient. againſt ſo megre and wretched a diſcourſe, what neede I ſay any thing?</p>
            <p>Yet partly leaſt you ſhould enter into preſumption, as if you had triumphed ouer me, and ſufficiently iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your ſelfe; and partly alſo to repreſſe that hautines of ſpirit that poſſeſſeth you, and maketh you ſo impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of due reproofe; and partly to cure your followers of that mad humor, that maketh them ſuppoſe you to be a man without blame and error; I haue vndertaken to examine, &amp; to looke into this treatiſe of yours more particulerly, although otherwiſe moſt vnworthy to be refuted, or looked vpon. and the rather for that your friend that hath made the preface before your booke,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21141:6"/>doeth make ſuch great brags of this defence, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo confidently vpon your innocencie, and would haue all my writings eſteemed and iudged according to this rule.</p>
            <p>I haue alſo added ſuch queſtions as you omitted, praying your anſwer for my ſatisfaction. if you miſlike this courſe, blame your ſelfe, that drew me forth to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie my doings, and would not giue mee any reſt by your importunitie. but if you doe ſtill like it, and will further proceede to charge mee with ſlandering you; then for your owne credite, if not at my requeſt, ſet downe my wordes truely and wholy, and forbeare to forge and deuiſe matters calumniouſly. I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you both in this booke and in my anſwere to <hi>M.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be, gentle Reader, that either thou mayeſt thinke mee contentious, that haue entred into this quarrell with <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> being a matter very friuolous, &amp; no way to any good purpoſe: or els very idle and at great laiſure, that haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els to buſie my ſelfe withall, vnleſſe I doe diſpute and talke of <hi>Hackets</hi> &amp; <hi>Penries</hi> matters, and <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> landes and liuings, and alſo of his domeſticall and inward affaires, and his priuate conceits and opinions. But yet, if thou wilt be pleaſed to conſider either the great credite and fame, which <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> hath amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his followers, that admire all his vanities; or els the importunitie of him, that made the preface to his booke, that would haue all my writings mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by this falſe and deceiuable line of <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologeticall challenge, by the which hee ſuppoſeth him to bee cleared, and mee to be quite diſgraced, and therefore ſeeketh to diſcredite all that I haue written in the common cauſe by the ſuppoſed vntruethes and ſlanders vttered against him, of which he taketh me as conuicted: I trust thou wilt pardon mee, although I doe examine euen theſe fond toyes, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, not worth a ſtraw; and grant, that it is to ſome good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if I doe cleare my ſelfe of thoſe fonde and ridiculous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, which hee would ſo willingly, and yet doeth ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely faſten vpon me.</p>
            <p>I was not ignorant, that wiſe men doe well perceiue this to bee an vncertaine, and deceitfull rule, conſidering that ſuch as write best are not voyde of errours, and very learned men doe often ſlip: yet ſuch is the iustice and cleareneſſe of my cauſe in this controuerſie betwixt <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and me, that I would not feare for once to allowe this rule, and to make the most ſimple iudge of my dealings herein. the which helpe ſeeing my cauſe doth afford me, I thought it not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb facs="tcp:21141:8"/>to leaue to ſuch clamorous aduerſaries any pretenſe of aduantage.</p>
            <p>I am therefore to pray thee not to accompt mee for this cauſe either contentious and quarrelſome, or els vnwilling to accept of conditions of peace; but rather to pitie mee, whom ſuch contentious fellowes with their vaine iangling, and clamarous complayning will not ſuffer to rest. I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer challenge any as yet; but ſtill wrote against thoſe, that had first entred into voluntary quarrels against this Church and ſtate. ſuch was my diſcourſe against <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Papists: ſuch alſo were thoſe two bookes which I wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole fraternitie of the diſciplinarians, and their extrauagant fancies. neither had I to doe either with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the petition, or with M. <hi>Iob Throk.</hi> before they did challenge me. ſeeing then this my anſwere to <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> is of the ſame nature, why ſhould the ſame bee more blamed, then my other doings?</p>
            <p>As for my leiſure, I aſſure thee, it was neuer leſſe. for yet there are not many dayes paſſed ſince the Fleete returned, wherein I was with others in her Maieſties ſeruice in the iourney of <hi>Guadix:</hi> and to ſet my things in order, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my ſelfe of my former trauailes, ſome time is required. as for idleneſſe, I doe detest it, and <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and his friendes (I thinke) will thereof diſcharge me. yet if his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory dealing, and his proloquutors inſolencie would haue ſuffered mee to rest; I could nowe haue bene content to put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> briefe vntill the next returne. but being prouoked by both, either to yeelde my ſelfe to haue done notorious wrong, or els to make anſwere; although my other buſines was great, and my eaſe none at all, yet haue I thought good to ſende them both away with a quicke diſpatch to rake vp ſome new accuſation or rather calumniation againſt me at ſome other time.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:21141:8"/>
            <p>This, certes, is the cauſe that ſpecially mooued me to looke into this newe matter, although both for the baſeneſſe of the ſubiect, and vnſufficiencie of the handling of the cauſe moſt vnworthy to bee anſwered, read, or regarded. for (I pray) what doeth it concerne, but <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> priuate cauſes, with which, were I not drawne to it, I am most vnwilling to meddle? yea, and in this cauſe of his owne, how doeth he be haue himſelfe? doeth hee not forbeare to anſwere the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most of thoſe questions which are demaunded of him? the examination of particulers, and the reading of this treatiſe will declare it. To come to the argument of this pamphlet, let vs ſee how he handleth it. he ſaith and in great wordes giueth out, <hi>that I haue ſlaundred him,</hi> and that, forſooth, <hi>in two diuers pointes,</hi> whereof the first (as hee ſaith) <hi>concerneth common maners,</hi> the ſecond <hi>toucheth his owne eſtate.</hi> but when hee deſcendeth from the toppe of his high ſtile to talke of particulers, either hee doeth not rightly alledge my wordes, and ſo faileth in his ground; or els frankly confeſſeth as much as I ſay; or els the matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he taketh himſelfe to be charged, are not criminall. but ſuppoſe I had ſpoken ſomewhat, that might offend him; yet I truſt his eſtate is not ſo high, but that it may be touched. I doe not thinke hee deſireth any royallestate, as ſome haue done; neither any priuiledged place, ſuch as licencious perſons ſeeke. for mine owne part, I muſt needes ſay, that I haue not read a more fond and friuolous diſpute.</p>
            <p>Like to <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> booke is that preface which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a great roume in this ſmall treatiſe. like lippes like let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: both vaine, both deuoyde of wit and learning. yet of the two the preface is more fond, aduancing <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> to the ſtate of innocencie; and more odious, being fraught with diuers rayling reproches. the authour ſeemeth to Maſter <hi>Iob Throkmorton</hi> an olde friend of mine, who by commending
<pb facs="tcp:21141:9"/>of M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſought to be reuenged on mee. And what he could not winne by commending him, that he ſeeketh <hi>by rayling and</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Inter hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas faceros ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niones faceti trendentes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra me dentibus ſuis. Pſalm. 35.</note> 
               <hi>gnaſhing his teeth vpon me.</hi> ſuch mery ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fellowes well doeth the Prophete deſcribe in his <hi>35.</hi> Pſalme. and ſuch dealing is not ſtrange in that gentleman, to whom I wiſh no other paine, then that for his ſcorning and rayling, for which his owne friendes call him <hi>gibing Iob,</hi> he doe not in the ende weepe full bitterly. I had thought the euill ſpeede and ſucceſſe hee had in his last letter would haue admoniſhed him to ſurceaſe writing either of letters, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces. But he is of the number of thoſe whom no harme will make wiſe, and percaſe is content eſpecially for M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi> ſake, to ſuffer ſome fewe gentle blowes in deduction of thoſe paines, which otherwiſe he hath deſerued.</p>
            <p>Against both the preface, and M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> briefe challenge I haue publiſhed this briefe anſwere. by which I truſt (by Gods grace) to defend my rightfull cauſe. thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhalt reape this profite. thou ſhalt ſee, that theſe men, ſo they could reteine their old credit, could be content to ſee the cauſe of their diſcipline deſerted, yea, and M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and M. <hi>Throkmorton</hi> will I truſt make ſo good vſe of it, as to learne to master their affections, and to tame their hauty minde, and to reſt when they are in the wrong, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to drawe men into quarrels that wiſheth them all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and meekeneſſe that ſhould bee in men of their ſort. I woulde to God, that theſe that ſo eagerly purſue mee for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed matter against themſelues, would in the ende come home, and make an amends for that publike ſlaunder and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace they haue offered to the ſtate. But what do I wiſh that, which will not bee had? ſuch men as are ſettled in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpoſes and courſes, wil not lightly giue ouer, that which once though vnaduiſedly they haue begun. I would therefore if their heades will not bee aduiſed, yet wiſh their followers to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21141:9"/>take heed, how they be abuſed by them, and to looke for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground, then ſuch froward leaders ſtrange conceits.</p>
            <p>This anſwere I pray thee read with patience, and looke not for any great learning in it. for it was deuiſed on the ſudden, and beſide that, it is framed vpon a baſe ſubiect, and a light matter of fact, and very needleſſe, if M. <hi>Carwright</hi> could ſo haue bene contented. Is it poſsible to draw water out of flint, or likely that wee ſhall gather grapes on thiſtles? M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> doeth not boaſt of miracles as hee ſaith, and I neuer profeſſed that I could worke them. what fruite then is to bee expected out of this rockie ſoile? Well, ſuch as it is, I pray thee accept this diſcourſe. and I would it were better for thy ſake. The best is, it ſhall not be long, nor I hope tedious: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leauing all other preambles, I come now to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the booke it ſelfe. But firſt a few wordes concerning the two diuers titles, that this petit pamphlet hath in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all places put before it.</p>

               <p>¶ The Anſwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough titles of bookes be according to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors fancies for the moſt part; and therefore not much to bee regarded: yet foraſmuch as there is ſome matter in them worthy to bee marked, I thought good to beginne with them. The firſt thing that I obſerue is the contrarietie and repugnance that is in the titles: which argueth, that the authors could not well tell, what to make of this treatiſe. The ſecond is the notorious falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood conteined in the titles, which declareth their bad dealing. The laſt is a plaine confeſſion of the aduerſary againſt himſelfe. for if <hi>all ſlanderous accuſations be anſwered,</hi> then whatſoeuer <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> is charged with, and not anſwered in this treatiſe, the ſame is confeſſed to be no ſlander.</p>
               <p>The repugnance appeareth diuerſly: the firſt title hath <hi>apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> the ſecond hath <hi>briefe.</hi> yet neither is euery apologie a briefe, nor euery briefe an apologie. true it is that the written copy hath, <hi>a briefe anſwere.</hi> but al commeth to one reckoning. for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefe anſwere is not an apologie, nor contrarywiſe. Nay the ſame maketh much againſt <hi>M. Cartwright.</hi> for his friend percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that his<note n="1" place="margin">M. Cartwrights briefe confeſſed by I. Throkmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to be no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> briefe conteined no ſufficient anſwere, put out an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and onely left vs a briefe: as it were a briefe or writte to ſummone me to looke to their dealing, and craftie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyances; or els a briefe or ſumme of their manifolde folies. the firſt title doeth pretend that <hi>M. Cartwr. is iniuriouſly loaden with ſlanderous accuſations;</hi> the ſecond maketh light of the matter, and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not at all. and ſure ſtrange it were, if a man ſhould be loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſo fewe lines, and ſuch light paper. the firſt braggeth <hi>that al accuſations are anſwered,</hi> but <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> ſeemeth more wiſe; and therefore profeſſeth no ſuch generall anſwere to be made. The firſt calleth my bookes pamphlets (no doubt the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was angrie with them:) the ſecond hath more gentle and modeſt termes. is it therefore likely, that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with me, that euen at the firſt daſh is ſo farre fallen out with his friend?</p>
               <p>The falſehood of theſe titles ſhall be diſcouered throughout this whole anſwere: and may alſo in part appeare by this, for that they both pretend, that I haue ſlandred <hi>M. Cartwright.</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21141:10"/>yet neither he nor his friend that ſo ſaucily prateth in the preface ſhall euer be able to iuſtifie their pretenſe. for<note n="1" place="margin">L. 1. ff. ad S. C. Turpil.</note> 
                  <hi>ſlander is a falſe imputation of matters criminall.</hi> but the matters which <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> taketh on him to anſwere are either moſt <hi>true,</hi> or not cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous. Beſides that, it is one thing to charge a man with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters criminall iudicially, and in his owne defence; another to charge him extradicially; or iudicially, and by way of accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. but that which I alledge is by way of exception and in my defence, and not with a minde to accuſe. Let him therefore that chargeth mee with accuſation iuſtifie his charge, and note the time and place when I committed this fault, and the wordes of my accuſation. In deede I mooued certaine queſtions. but there is great difference betwixt queſtioning and accuſing. the ende of queſtioning is reſolution: the ende of accuſing puniſhment. let him therefore ſhew whom I haue accuſed, or proſecuted in iudgement to haue him puniſhed. Laſt of all the author of the firſt title complaineth of iniurious dealing. but <hi>M Cartwright</hi> I thanke him doeth friendly diſcharge me; and I doubt not, but I ſhalbe able moſt clearely to diſcharge my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The confeſſion of the aduerſary againſt himſelfe is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly ſet downe in the firſt title. for if all accuſations that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſlander, are anſwered as the title pretendeth, then is <hi>M.

               <head>¶ A note of certaine ſpeciall matters which haue bene demaunded of <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and <hi>his conſorts, and whereto in this his briefe</hi> he anſwered nothing.</head>
               <p>FIrſt I<note n="2" place="margin">Anſwere to the pet. p. 185, q. 2.</note> demaunded of all the diſciplinarians, of which I take <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> to be the leader, whether thoſe that would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow not onely the priuileges and liberties of the Church of England, but alſo the whole Eccleſiaſtical eſtate, their iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo, and liuings; ſeeke not the ouerthrow of <hi>Magna charta,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21141:11"/>and infinite ſtatutes, and of a great part of the common lawes of the Realme, and ſeeke thereby the diſhonour of her Maieſtie and the ſtate, by requiring at her hands things that tend to the violating of the othe of Princes taken at their Coronation, and the ouerthrow of the rewards of learning. and whether ſuch as are chiefe doers in theſe cauſes, are longer to be ſuffered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in their preſumption. This I demaunded, to this <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> ſaith nothing.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe,<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 4.</note> I asked whether the booke of <hi>Fenner</hi> that is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <hi>ſacra theologia,</hi> and came foorth with the allowance of <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> conteine not ſtrange diuinitie. This queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth many members, euen ſo many as there are ſtrange poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the holy Trinitie, the Lawe, the Goſpel, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and ſuch holy myſteries of diuinitie. yet <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> ſatisfieth me in nothing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 5.</note> I deſired to be reſolued, whether it be not reaſon to make <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> recant thoſe dangerous opinions, which vnder his credite come foorth commended in that booke. And whether hee and his fellowes haue not made a newe booke of prayer and adminiſtration of Sacraments, and practiſed the ſame or ſome part thereof without authoritie: and whether they deſerue not to be called in queſtion for publiſhing of newe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of faith, and new doctrine. and what anſwereth he? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth nothing. It might alſo further be demaunded more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly of <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> whether in that communion booke which the diſciplinarian faction offred to the Parliament, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to haue it authorized &amp; receiued throughout the Realme, and which for the moſt part was either framed by his aduiſe, or allowed by his conſent, there are not two articles taken out of the Creede, namely <hi>that of Chriſtes buriall, and his deſcending into hell,</hi> and whether there is not a newe article added <hi>binding all men to beleeue their new diſcipline.</hi> making that a matter of faith. and whether this be not a plaine violence offered to mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and an alteration of our ancient faith. Likewiſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is not one petition wanting in the Lords prayer, and their new paraphraſe vpon it.<note place="margin">Theolog. ſacr. lib. 1.</note> Likewiſe whether <hi>M. Fenner</hi> in his booke of diuinitie, which <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> as it were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizeth with his letters of commendation, doe not confound eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21141:11"/>and perſon in the diuine nature, and deuide the perſons of the Trinitie into two members, and talke fooliſhly of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall generation of the Sonne of God and of the proceeding of the holy Ghoſt, and teach that hatred as it is one of the attributes of God, is the eſſence of God; And laſtly whether <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> will allow this for ſound diuinitie. In his next writ of ſlanders, may it pleaſe him to ſhape vs a direct anſwere to theſe matters.<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly it was demaunded by what authoritie the miniſters of forreine Churches take on them to preſcribe formes of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and new lawes to our Church. Likewiſe it might be asked by what rule <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> taketh on him the miniſtery in our Church hauing no ordination (vnleſſe it be of deacon) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lawes of this Church.</p>
               <p>Fiftly I deſired to be reſolued,<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 22.</note> whether all the errours of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowiſme</hi> do not follow, and may be concluded of <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> and his conſorts aſſertions. and whether it bee a matter fit that theſe men ſhould deale with that ſort of ſectaries, and not rather be conſtrained publikely to recant their owne foule errors. All theſe queſtions <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> anſwereth with ſilence.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 24.</note> I mooued a queſtion whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and his conſorts do not either flatly deny or call in queſtion the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall points of her Maieſties ſupremacie. and whether they take not from her power to ordeine rites and orders for the Church; likewiſe authoritie to nominate Biſhops, to appoint Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call commiſſioners, and to delegate learned men to heare the laſt appeale from Eccleſiaſtical courts, to cal ſynodes, and other authoritie giuen to the prince by the lawes of England: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure to bring in forreine lawes, and iuriſdiction repugnant to the ſtatute of the princes ſupremacie, and prerogatiue, and the lawes and liberties both of the Church of England, and of her Maieſties ſubiects. if <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> meant to haue ſatisfied the doubt concerning his opinion, and conceit of her Maieſties ſupremacie, as he goeth about it; he ought to haue anſwered this queſtion directly and particulerly. not doing it, who ſeeth not that he ſlideth away in cloudes of generalitie, and priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites of his owne fancy concerning this matter?</p>
               <p>Seuenthly it was demaunded,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the petit. q. 26. &amp; 29.</note> whether by <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> rules in thoſe places where they are receiued the Church goods
<pb facs="tcp:21141:12"/>are not ſpoiled, and the liuings of the miniſtery deuided, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of learning taken away, and alſo whether, if the ſame ſhould here be receiued, the like wrack would not be wrought, and her Maieſtie depriued of tenthes and ſubſidies, and a great part of her reuenues, and of many faithfull and loyall ſeruitors, which by thoſe lawes being made vnable to liue, would alſo be made vnable to doe her ſeruice. Hee hath nothing to anſwere, that will make for him.</p>
               <p>Eightly it was asked,<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 30.</note> whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers haue not in all places where they haue bene receiued, made ſectes and diuiſions, and hardened mens hearts, and filled their minds with pride and humorous vanities. to which he ſaith nothing. Percaſe he knoweth it is no ſlander.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 31.</note> I demaunded whether it be not dangerous for this ſtate, that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and his partakers haue ſo much vrged this Church to imitate the examples of <hi>Geneua</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> conſidering the dangerous courſes which they tooke, and the hard effects, that followed of them. It cannot be denied: and therefore <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> holdeth his peace.</p>
               <p n="10">10.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 33.</note> The queſtion was asked whether that the ſubuerſion of the ſtate of the Church, which foloweth neceſſarily of <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi> diſciplinarian deuiſes, is not a great ſcandale, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the reformation of true Religion in other places. It is moſt apparent, and therefore <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> forbeareth to anſwere.</p>
               <p n="11">11.<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 34.</note> It is demaunded whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> doe not as well ſubiect Princes to excommunication, as <hi>Sanders</hi> or <hi>Allen</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſtes: and whether his doctrine is not as pernicious to princes authoritie, as theirs. It muſt needs be granted: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he paſſeth by, and ſaith iuſt nothing.</p>
               <p n="12">12.<note place="margin">Anſwere to the petit. qu. 49.</note> A doubt is made whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> doth beleeue, that ſubiects may rebel againſt ſuch Kings, as they accompt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or tyrants, as ſome of that ſide haue taught: and hee paſſeth by in a graue ſilence.</p>
               <p n="13">13.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 51.</note> It is asked, whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and his felowes haue not aſſembled in ſynodes, or rather conuenticles, and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted &amp; decreed certeine rules &amp; orders contrary to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties lawes, and alſo ſubſcribed them &amp; procured others to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21141:12"/>them, and by all poſſible meanes gone about without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to put the ſame in practiſe, and to diſcredite and diſgrace the lawes of her Maieſtie, and ancient gouernment of Chriſt his Church. This is moſt true, and therefore paſſed ouer in ſilence.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Idemaunded alſo whether they haue not in their ſaid or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 52.</note> which they call <hi>holy diſcipline,</hi> taken al authoritie in Church cauſes from the Chriſtian magiſtrate, and giuen it to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories and ſynodes, in ſo much that the magiſtrate is not once mentioned in that platforme; and further I would know, how the ſufferance of theſe proceedings may ſtand with the maieſtie of a Prince, and with gouernment. Likewiſe it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> how he that hath bound himſelfe to this forme of diſcipline by his word &amp; ſubſcription, may be thought to allow of her Maieſties ſupreme gouernment which the lawes of this land doe giue vnto her. In this caſe he is as ſilent, as <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15.<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 53.</note> I deſired to knowe whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> haue not taught, that the authoritie which they challenge to their elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and ſynodes by their holy diſcipline, as they call it, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed nor diminiſhed, whether the prince be Chriſtian or heathen; and likewiſe, if he do not thinke, or haue not taught, that the authoritie of a Chriſtian and heathen prince is all one, and that a Chriſtian king hath no more to doe with the Church gouernment, then any pagan prince, or Emperour hath: but he will tell vs nothing.</p>
               <p n="16">16.<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 54.</note> I asked <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> whether he &amp; his adherents haue not put the greateſt part of their diſcipline in practiſe, without her Maieſties conſent, authoritie, or allowance: and likewiſe without her authoritie or knowledge haue not both made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret meetings, and eſtabliſhed diuers newe orders, and broched newe opinions, and all contrary to the doctrine, faith, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of this Church of England: this ſtring <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> dare not touch.</p>
               <p n="17">17.<note place="margin">Ibidem. q. 55.</note> I asked him whether hee was not preſumptuous (if no more) in doing theſe things, and whether he ought not to bee brought publikely to ſubmit himſelfe for his faults. Likewiſe it may bee here asked of him, whether hauing both in <hi>Fenners</hi> booke, and his replies and writings taught, written, and allowed
<pb facs="tcp:21141:13"/>diuers points of falſe-doctrine; he is not to be brought to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like recantation, for ſatisfaction of thoſe weake ones, that hee hath offended: will it pleaſe him yet to anſwere this queſtion directly?</p>
               <p n="18">18.<note place="margin">Anſwere to the petit. qu. 57.</note> I demaunded whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> ſwore truely in the Starre-chamber, when he affirmed on his oth, <hi>that he neuer affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or allowed that in euery monarchie there ought to be certain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates like to the Spartaine</hi> Ephori, <hi>with authoritie to controll and depoſe the king, and to proceed further against him,</hi> ſeeing he called <hi>M.

               <p n="19">19.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 58.</note> I would alſo vnderſtand whether <hi>M.

               <p n="20">20.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 59.</note> I deſired to heare whether <hi>M.

It may alſo be further demaunded of him how this forme
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21141:13"/>may be deemed perfect, ſeeing they confeſſe they were not yet reſolued vpon diuers points. <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> anſwereth nothing.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I demanded whether <hi>M.

               <p n="22">22.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 61.</note> I doubted whether <hi>M.

               <p n="23">23.<note place="margin">Ibidem q. 75.</note> I demaunded whether <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> did reueile to any magiſtrate the letters of <hi>Copinger,</hi> or his ſtrange deſeignements: but he deigneth not to ſatiſfie any ſuch demaund.</p>
               <p n="24">24.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 92.</note> I asked whether <hi>M.

               <p n="25">25.<note place="margin">Ibidem qu. 93.</note> I deſired to know whether M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> or ſome friend of his did not threaten exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication againſt a certeine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant at <hi>Middlebourg,</hi> if he would not deſiſt purſuing a ſeruant of his that had waſted his goods, and whether ſuch courſes bee allowable.

               <p>Beſide theſe queſtions, diuers other matters were asked of of M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in the Starre-chamber, whereto he hath either anſwered nothing at all, or nothing to purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Being demaunded,<note place="margin">Interrog. 2.</note> how far forth he hath affirmed or alowed the Queenes authoritie Eccleſiaſticall to bee reſtreined by the iniunctions, vnder colour whereof diuers allow and ſweare to

               <p>TO conclude this point, compare I beſeech you, this anſwer and apologie of M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> with my queſtions and the interrogatories, whereupon he was examined in the Starre-chamber throughout: and you ſhall find that he paſſed by moſt of my queſtions in ſilence, not once daring to touch them, or to looke vpon them; and that hee was no way able to cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of thoſe matters that were obiected againſt him in the Starre-chamber: and I thinke, he will not, ſure I am, he cannot
<pb facs="tcp:21141:15"/>deny ſo much to be true. if he doe; let him take what time hee will, and directly and particulerly anſwere theſe queſtions and interrogatories in his next apologie. but I know he neither mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſo to doe, nor can well do it. I do therefore conclude firſt, that (if as he ſaith and diſputeth in his whole anſwere) all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions be charges, or (as the title hath) accuſations; then is hee accuſed and charged with diuers enormous matters. Secondly, if he hath anſwered all ſlanderous accuſations in this his apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, then that all theſe things which are not anſwered are truely obiected, and are no ſlanders. Which being granted, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that his friend had ſmall skill that painted him out in the proper lineaments, as he ſaith, of innocencie. and if he ſay, that this is nothing but a cauill; then let him the next time anſwere all theſe matters directly and ſufficiently; and I my ſelfe will giue him, not onely the robe of innocencie, which his friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on him, but alſo wil crowne him with a garland of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and place him in the triumphant charet of victory, to his perpetuall honour among all his folowers, that like of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian forgeries.</p>
               <p>Thoſe wordes alſo out of the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> which are ſet vnder the firſt title, are a moſt euident teſtimonie againſt the author of the Preface, who likewiſe ſeemeth to haue fitted to himſelfe this ſentence. for, <hi>if righteous men abhorre lyes,</hi> why hath he tolde his Lady ſo many vaine tales and fables? forſoth, becauſe hee is an vngodly felow. and therefore that is come to paſſe that folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſentence: <hi>the vngodly ſhameth himſelfe, and is put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> for <hi>M. Iob Throkmorton</hi> in his rude and euil ſhapen letter hath ſhamed himſelfe, and as a man that is at the ende of his role, hauing reeiued his anſwere is put to ſilence. Let <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> take heed that his happe be not like his felowes, and that for expected glory he receiue not ſhame, and ſtoppe when hee hath runne his courſe in a ſuddein ſilence. This ſentence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, albeit the ſame neither agree with the Hebrew text, nor with the olde Latine tranſlation, nor with the Geneuian tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Engliſh, yet ſhall paſſe for once, without correction.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond title <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> calleth me doctor, I truſt he doeth it not in ſcorne. for the time was when himſelfe deſired both the degree and title of doctour, and yet could not haue it.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21141:15"/>percaſe hee was put backe for his innocencie. ſure ſomewhat it was, that made the Vniuerſitie deny that to him, that it vſeth to deny, but to very few and for iuſt cauſes. Beſide that, hee would haue doctors to be chiefe men in the new commonwealth of his conſiſtory, and great pillers of the diſciplinarian ſtate.</p>
               <p>He doth alſo call mee deane of Exeter, giuing mee an office which himſelfe hath condemned as antichriſtian. but his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is declared erroneous, and fooliſh. For what reaſon hath a maſter of an Hoſpitall to condemne a deane? the time was, I thanke him, when hee ſeemed very carefull how deanes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which hee had determined by his magiſtrale authoritie ſhould looſe their liuings, ſhould be mainteined. but now hee is acquited of that care, and turned along to looke to his domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affaires. May it therefore pleaſe him to let deanes alone, and looke to his owne reckenings. if not, hee ſhall well vnderſtand, that deanes are in honeſtie and otherwiſe, aboue ſuch as hee is, though hee were maſter of more then one Hoſpitall, and that himſelfe is no ſuch man, but that we may talke of him without incurring <hi>ſcandalum magnatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwere hee calleth <hi>a briefe.</hi> and what briefe? forſooth a briefe to printed ſlanders. as if there were any relation betwixt briefes and ſlanders, or els, as if ſlanders were properly ſaid to be printed. Sure, if <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> were ſo wiſe as he is taken to be, hee would neuer haue printed theſe ſlanders himſelfe, nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this ſimple &amp; weake diſcourſe, nor without cauſe or good purpoſe brought his name into queſtion. But ſeeing he would needes haue it ſo, who can be againſt it? ſhould the conſiſtoriall elders proclaime a faſt and deſire God to turne his minde? Nay ſeeing he will make himſelfe the ſubiect of this diſpute, and call me forth to contend with him, let vs begin and ſee what either his friend in his preface, or himſelfe in his briefe returnable 10. dayes before this terme, can ſay for their defence. and leaſt either might complaine of wrong, they ſhall both ſpeake in their owne natural language. Liſt therefore I pray you. for here comes in the prologue, a goodly graue fellow, ye neede not doubt.</p>

The prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor like a monte banke he pointeth to this diſcourſe which hee imagineth to be a rare peece of workmanſhip painted out by <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> as it were another <hi>Appelles;</hi> and promiſeth that within we ſhall ſee this ſtrange creature he ſpeaketh of. but hee doeth but abuſe his reader, to feede him thus with ſtrange fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. We haue ſought euery corner of this treatiſe, and finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a rude peece of worke not worth the reading: hard wordes, diſioynted ſentences, weake proofes, bad anſweres, and nothing worthy commendation. as for innocencie, it was not there to be found. nay while we ſought for innocencie we found nothing but a certeine odde fellow in a corner, whoſe head was all diſtempered with rheumes of diſcipline, and a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted conceites, and by him the author of this preface poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at him, and calling all men in, to beholde innocencie. But thoſe that ſaw them both, and their demeanours as well as I, ſaid that there was nothing els to be ſeene but a trifling pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, and that all the Prefators deuiſe was nothing but a packe of foolery.</p>

               <p>But to leaue this felowes painting and pourtraying, that hath no more skill to paint then a cobler to draw like <hi>Appelles;</hi> and whoſe bad grace is ſuch, that there appeareth no other worke of his beſide diſtempered humors, reprochfull words, and vaine and idle talke; What more ridiculous <hi>proſopaea</hi> could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then this, to make <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> that alwayes hated playes and ſpoke againſt them, to play a part? and what part? forſooth a womans part, which of all parts he moſt deteſted. The eſpecial grace of a <hi>proſopopaea</hi> is to obſerue <hi>decorum,</hi> the which by this manis no way regarded. for what is more childiſh then to make an olde man play a childs part? and <hi>M.

And beſides that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> was very ſimple not to be able to ſhewe vs this cleare innocencie, which is here ſo inuiſibly portrayed.

                  <bibl>¶ The preface.</bibl>
                  <p>Being, thou ſeeſt, thus prouoked as<note n="1" place="margin">Who was it, that did thus challenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie? and where?</note> ſhe is, or rather, to ſpeake the trueth, thus violently drawen into the encounter by the wretched aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of an<note n="2" place="margin">Men haue great reaſon to beware of the leauen of the Puritans, and Phariſees.</note> vnleauened mouth: yet marke I pray thee, how ſhee caries her ſelfe, and how ſhe comes<note n="3" place="margin">All armed like <hi>Pallas.</hi> whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that <hi>Iob Threkmorton</hi> is not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie. for he neuer yet bore armes to do her Maieſtie ſeruice.</note> armed into the field.</p>
               </q>
               <p>¶ The anſwere.</p>
               <p>All this bill is erroneous. <hi>Being,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>thou ſeeſt, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked.</hi> yet he hath better eyes then common, that can ſee any ſteppe or likelyhood in <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> diſcourſe, of any ſuch matter. I for my part certes neuer prouoked, or encountred or vſed violence to innocencie. neither dealing with <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> the perſon on whom this vizard of innocencie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomly put, were either my reaſons ſo ſimple, that hee hath yet come foorth to anſwere them, nor his cauſe ſo good, that he might wel put the ſame vpon any further trial. His dealing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe that abandoned the fielde was rather wretched then mine, as thoſe that fly before the enemie and dare not make
<pb facs="tcp:21141:17"/>head are moſt miſerable and cowardly ſouldiers. yea in theſe matters that he goeth about to anſwere, he hath ſo badly acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe, that beſide this fellowe that hath no iudgement, none will cleare him. But could he cleare himſelfe in them, yet there are diuers other matters to be obiected to him of which hee ſhall neuer be able to cleare himſelfe. his errours and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in diuinitie prooued by his commendations of <hi>Fenners</hi> booke: his implied deniall of her Maieſties prerogatiue and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in making and abrogating Eccleſiaſtical lawes, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of commiſſioners and delegates, his malicious purpoſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the preſent Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, his ſaucie and vnciuil rayling and dealing againſt the prelacie of England, his notorious vntrueths and forgeries in maintenance of his new deuiſes: his ſchiſmatical meetings and conuenticles, his vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miniſtery without iuſt calling, his turbulent dealing for his elderſhip, and many other matters to be obiected againſt him ſhal he neuer be able to anſwere. What a ridiculous matter then was it, that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> ſhould ſtill be made to play the part of lady innocencie, a lady that hee and <hi>Iob Throkmorton</hi> ſhould ſeeme to be but little acquainted withall? nay how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd was it, that ſo graue and ancient a man as <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> at the bending of whoſe browes all the aldermen of the Church ſtood amaſed, ſhould here be ſtripped of his prieſtly ornaments, and put into a womans attire to play innocencie, of whom now we muſt ſpeake onely in the <hi>feminine gender,</hi> and make a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betwixt him and <hi>Miſtris Cartwright,</hi> giuing him the title of ſhe, and diſabling him for euer being preſident of the conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? this is therefore abſurd and ridiculous talking. That which hee ſaith of vnleauened mouthes is mere rayling. a matter not ſtrange with <hi>M. Throkmorton,</hi> whoſe mouth is leauened with Phariſaiſme, and blacke with Puritaniſme, and diſtaſted with late learning they ſay of certeine Hebraiſmes. He telleth vs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taking a ſtand vpon an oken tree in an iuie buſh wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to marke. for he hath ſprong innocencie like a ſeely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritch out of the buſhes of <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> booke, and ſhee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth flyeth out all armed. which is not onely abſurd, but very miraculous. For what more abſurd, then that ſhe ſhould come forth out of a diſcourſe, and like <hi>Pallas</hi> come all armed: or more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21141:17"/>miraculous, then that all this ſhould bee wrought by certeine wordes without all coniuration or legierdemaine of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquutor?</p>

               <p>¶ The Anſwere.</p>
               <p>It is no marueile although we haue warres, when innocencie her ſelfe is made ſuch a great fighter, and quarreller. but this is the Prefators art. and yet they ſay, he is no ſuch great warriour, that all the while that diuers valiant men were on the Seas, and at <hi>Cadix</hi> in her Maieſties ſeruice, was either writing ſuch rayling and lewd prefaces in corners, as this: or els calculating the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his deuiſes by the aſpect of the ſtarres, or els feeding his carkaſe with deintie fare, and his enuious minde with malicious reports. A very haſtie fellow to fight in words: ſo haſtie that he had no leyſure to fit his ſentences. for, I pray you, how are theſe wordes, <hi>patience, mildeneſſe, trueth and a good conſcience,</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? but his diſioynting of ſentences is not the worſt of his cauſe. a fouler matter it is, that arming <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and other vertues and good parts, he forgot both wit, and charitie. right according to his owne brainleſſe doings, that in them haue no wit: and according to the Puritan dealings that are commonly without charitie. Beſides this, al this deſcription and armour conſiſting in many vertues, no way belongeth to M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> That he hath no good voyce nor face to play in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, it appeareth by his anſweres in the Starre-chamber, by his writings, and all his dealings. As for patience, how can hee claime it, that is ſo vnpatient of due reproofe, and commeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>M.I. Throk.</hi> that now for ought I know holdeth his peace, vnleſſe he percaſe ſpeake in this preface? And what hath hee to do with mildeneſſe in whoſe face there is a ſtorme of anger, and in whoſe writings there is ſuch rough, and rude dealing againſt lawes, and againſt his ſuperiours? Now where there is forging,
<pb facs="tcp:21141:18"/>deuiſing, and <hi>Machiauelian</hi> plotting, how can there bee either trueth, or a good conſcience? All which courſes if they ſhall be prooued to haue bene vſed in his doings and writings, then it is cleare, that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> is no ſuch fighter, nor ſo wel armed as is reported. which alſo appeareth in this, that throwing downe his armes wherwith he was wont to fight, and abandoning that cauſe for which he in time paſt made ſuch bragges, he doth now onely skirmiſh with certaine vaine fancies, as <hi>Vliſſes</hi> did with ſhadowes in his feined deſcent to hell. Now hee hath lurked a great while, <hi>Vt marinae filius Thetidis ſub lachrymoſa tempora Troiae.</hi> if <hi>Vulcane</hi> would make him a harneſſe for his head, it would doe him percaſe more good, then all his furniture.</p>
               <p>Further he telleth vs, that the ſame things do ſerue <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> who is figured vnder innocencie both for armour and weapons. hee meaneth perhaps to thruſt all men through with his head peece. which is a ſtrange caſe. But what ſhould a man marueile, if this fellow confound armour, and weapons, that would confound both Church and common wealth?</p>
               <p>Finally as if <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> had not bene abuſed ſufficiently by the Prefator in diſguiſing him in the womaniſh attire and habit of innocencie, he doth here make him play the part of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, of whom he is made to borow theſe words, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> a perſon no way becomming him, hauing in his replies vſed farre other ſtile and language, and not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>Michael</hi> did about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but about mere ſhadowes and fancies. Let <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> take heede ſo many parts hath hee played, that the Prefator if hee continue on this courſe a while, make him not play <hi>S. George</hi> on horſebacke. for that in deede is his beſt part, threatning ſo long and ſtriking ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: riding continually, and yet neuer comming to his iourneys end. All the world knoweth and ſeeth, that neither his deedes, nor his words are angelicall. neither is he ſo victorious as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> being no way able to make head againſt his aduerſaries, or to anſwere their arguments.</p>

               </q>
               <p>¶ The anſwere.</p>
               <p>That <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> was vnlike <hi>Saluſt,</hi> or that I faile not, the authour of that oration wherein theſe wordes were written, is not denied. for neither hath hee the eloquence, nor the skill in Latin, that he that made that oration, had. nor did that authour ſo fondly talke and vainly write, as <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> doth. What reaſon then hath this odde babler, and rayler, to call him a bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling declaymer, but to ſhewe vs, that this ſect taketh pleaſure to bite both quicke and dead, and to bable without either rime or reaſon? beſide this, what notorious ignorance is it to call theſe wordes which the Oratour vttereth againſt his aduerſary, <hi>a leſſon,</hi> as it were of a teacher to his auditory? indeed this Prefator doth well practiſe this ſuppoſed leſſon, albeit he hath not ſo well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame. For if he had, he would not haue written <hi>cepiſti</hi> with an <hi>oe</hi> dipthong. hee might therefore doe well to ſpare to ſpeake Latin, and let vs heare ſome better Engliſh.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, is it likely, that this preface wherin ſo many reproches and malicious termes are ſtuffed, ſhould be put there without his priuitie? or muſt not he iuſtifie his preface, and anſwere for

               <p>In the former part of this preface, you haue ſeene how the writer hath played the painter: now to teach you, that hee hath more ſhifts and occupations to liue by then one, he taketh vpon him to play the doctor, and teacheth vs that himſelfe neuer learned; to wit, a long leſſon of <hi>patience.</hi> ſo litle doeth he know in what ground he ſtandeth, or what is conuenient for him, that he preacheth patience out of his preface.

Neither are we to feare, that ſuch odious declaymers as this, that hath now taken to himſelfe a litle more libertie then ordinary, ſhall ſtill be ſuffered to blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out their tempeſtuous and railing ſpeaches. As for thoſe that haue written in defence of the lawes of England and ancient rites of the Church, they are not to take it to heart, albeit by this lewd fellow they be railed at, as a reuiling generation, that blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out vntrueth without ſhame. It is the faſhion of heretickes, ſchiſmatickes and wicked companions to raile at honeſt men. ſo did <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Porphyrius</hi> raile againſt the Chriſtians, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the ſchiſmaticall <hi>Donatiſts</hi> againſt <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> againſt true beleeuers. What then although this railing Prefator do degorge his malice againſt vs? why? hath he not alſo blaſphemed the holy Spirit of God? doth he not ſay, <hi>that God doth blast mens pennes with alying ſpirit,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the wicked action to God, which is the fountaine of trueth and all goodneſſe? reade the words, and examine them; and you ſhall finde it to be as I ſay. He ſaith not, that God doth ſend out wicked ſpirits, or ſuffer wicked ſpirits of lying to blaſt mens pennes: but, <hi>that God blaſteth mens pennes with a ſpirit of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> as if Gods breathing or Spirit did infect mens pennes with
<pb facs="tcp:21141:21"/>lying. Looke on it <hi>M.

Is it not ſufficient for you to abuſe men, but you muſt alſo blaſpheme God? And you my maſters of the rayling ſect of Martiniſtes, before you accuſe others of reuiling, and blundring out vntruthes, looke on your ſelues and your felowes. I thinke <hi>M.

But this man had onely care to ſpeake euill, that which ſhould be his ſpecial care, he doth not regard. for he proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I truſt <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> who is now canonized by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fator, and become <hi>S.

Nay if I do not iuſtifie as much as I haue affirmed, let mee haue puniſhment: which will wonderfully content this malicious generation. nay I will not take vantage of his wordes which giue colour to any contradiction or gainſaying. But if I doe not iuſtifie ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as I haue affirmed; let law paſſe. But if I do not onely gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21141:21"/>but iuſtly gainſay <hi>M.

Of what haire he is, I will not diſpute, they ſay and I ſee, he hath not one haire of an honeſt man. He ſaith alſo, that other my felowes writings ſhalbe apparantly conuicted of vntrueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all gainſay. and for proofe referreth vs to this braue defence of <hi>M. Cartwright.</hi> But his aſſertion is very impudent, and his proofe ridiculous. for how doth <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> conuince thoſe againſt whom he ſaith nothing? was not the Prefator aſhamed to ſhuffle things thus together? ſure neither my friends nor I am afraid of any thing <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> either hath ſaid, or can ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Neither do I thinke that he ſhall ſpeed better then his friend <hi>Iob Throkmorton</hi> did the laſt yeere. he bragged much of his defence againſt my ſlanders, as he called them. but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are prooued ſo true, that albeit the man hath great luſt to bite and grinneth and grumbleth in corners, like a rough haired water ſpaniel, yet I do not once, as yet, heare him openly barke. And I hope likewiſe in this treatiſe ſo to refute this briefe, that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> will be aduiſed, ere he ſend me foorth his reply. by which I doubt not, but to make cleare that I haue not diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any wrongfully, nor bene ſo vnaduiſed, as this man giueth forth very vnaduiſedly, and impudently. There ſhall it appeare alſo whether I haue bene taken ſo tardy, that the ſtones and walles may conuince me of vntrueth, as he affirmeth very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly. for what more blockiſh deuiſe, then to make ſtones and walles diſputers? Are theſe fellowes ſo powerfull that they can make walles to ſpeake, and ſo dul that they cannot conuince me, when ſtones and walles can do it? The walles he ſaith ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them. ô braue floure of thetoricall amplification worthy to proceed from a man made of doogeon, nay made of ſtone, and to bee ſet in a wall to confute all men that ſhall contradict the fancies of Puritaniſme!

To ſatisfie thoſe that knowe mee not, I anſwere firſt that I neuer could play nor vſed to play at dice in my life. ſecondly that I neuer was before the elders of <hi>Geneua</hi> while I was there. thirdly, I neuer hated them nor had cauſe to hate them, albeit I enquired whether any ſuch Eccleſiaſtical of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were euer in the Church or no. fourthly <hi>M.

Laſtly if any ſuch thing had bene, it would haue bene ſpoken of before this, it being 17. yeere ſince I came from thence. this report I thinke <hi>M.

               <p>The matters that I charge them withall are built vpon other grounds then heareſay. and that ſhall <hi>M.

More wiſdome therefore were it for him, not to name the Deane of Exeter in ſuch ſcornefull maner, when all ſcorne him rather, that was ouerthrowne in his own challenge, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhewed himſelf either at home or abroad to haue any value.</p>

               <p>¶ The anſwere.</p>
               <p>Here the Prefator mooueth a needleſſe controuerſie, <hi>whether</hi> M.

Cartwr. <hi>with ignorance is mere impudencie. ſo many vniuerſities,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21141:24"/>Churches, and nations being able to controll it: and that he may with equall reaſon bee charged with diſloyaltie, and ignorance.</hi> a matter founding very harſhlie (I thinke) in <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> eares. for which I referre the man ouer to be baſtonated and corrected by <hi>M. Cartwright.</hi> that which he ſaith againſt me, whom he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to haue charged <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> both with ignorance, and diſloyaltie, remaineth of me to be anſwered. He ſaith firſt, <hi>that others thinke,</hi> meaning his owne conſorts. but if the Prefator wil not beleeue what honeſt men vpon iuſt cauſe report, it skilleth not much, what ſuch companions thinke. He giueth <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> the title of <hi>reuerend.</hi> yet doth he litle deſerue it, that neuer reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced his ſuperiors, nor reſpected antiquitie, nor cared for lawe or dutie. He diſputeth, as if I ſhould charge <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ignorance, which I doe not remember. true it is, that I do charge him with ignorance in diuers points. and that charge is neither ſtrange, nor vndeſerued, nor vntrue. His ignorance in all antiquitie is totoo apparant. for al his plot of diſcipline is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a mere miſtaking of ancient hiſtories. all olde writers do teſtifie, that the ancient Church next after the Apoſtles had diuers degrees of miniſters of the word, and commonly name them, <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> that appeareth out of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> commonly called <hi>Areopagita,</hi> out of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Euſebius, Hierome, Auguſtine, Theodoret</hi> and al the fathers, whoſe words are often cited by vs to that purpoſe. The authors of the<note n="1" place="margin">Cent. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> de gubernat. eccleſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Centuries</hi> confeſſe, <hi>That the fathers of the Church that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Apoſtles, had degrees of perſons in the Church.</hi> And yet <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> imagined, that all Biſhops and miniſters of the word were equall; and went about to proue it out of the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> The ancient fathers giue authoritie to Biſhops ouer tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching elders; hee abrogateth all authoritie from them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them equall, and all one. They ſpeake onely of elders that were miniſters of the word; M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that the priests that came to the councell of</hi> Nice, (of which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made in<note n="2" place="margin">In vita Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <hi>Socrates,</hi>) <hi>were gouerning elders.</hi> But he ſhould remember, they gaue no definite voice, and ſhould haue bene excluded from the company of their wiues, if <hi>Paphnutius</hi> had not reſiſted the purpoſe of thoſe, that would haue that decree paſſe: which to interpret of elders onely gouernours, is mere ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb facs="tcp:21141:25"/>in matter of hiſtory, and direct againſt M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> plot.</p>
               <p>His ignorance in the fathers appeareth both by the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and by his continuall miſallegation, and miſconſtruing of them. To goe no further, examine that chapter or<note n="1" place="margin">1. reply.</note> ſection which hee hath framed to prooue that the election of miniſters ought to be made by the people. And alſo<note n="2" place="margin">1. reply. p. 99. &amp; 100.</note> thoſe places where he would proue, that Biſhops whereof the ancient fathers make mention, were onely paſtors of one pariſh, and had none other paſtors or pariſhes, but one vnderneth them.</p>
               <p>His ignorance of diuinitie is teſtified to the world, firſt, by his vnaduiſed approbation of <hi>Fenners</hi> booke, which is the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all diuinitie, although called by M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, and approued for an excellent peece of workemanſhip: next, by the newe confeſſion of faith, and newe formes of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet downe in that new Communion booke, whereof hee was either chiefe author or chiefe fauourer and approuer. Laſtly in that new diſcipline, which hee falſly affirmeth to bee drawne out of Gods word.</p>
               <p>His ignorance in the Latin tongue is made famous by that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of his, that is ſet before <hi>Fenners</hi> booke, which is the onely thing of his, that euer I ſaw in Latin, and is full of ſoloeciſmes. In the beginning there is a groſſe ſoloeciſme in theſe wordes: <hi>Tua legens, &amp;c. ſubijt mentemde</hi> Moſe <hi>viro Dei hiſtoria.</hi> Likewiſe an improprietie in theſe words <hi>coelestis Canaan axiomata.</hi> for <hi>axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> ſignifie rules of arte, not lawes of ſtate. Theſe words, <hi>vt me adomnia mea officia quae in te proficiſci poſſunt arctius deuinxeris,</hi> haue bad ſence, and a barbarous phraſe. In the 2. page lin. 14. <hi>communices,</hi> is put for <hi>communicaris</hi> nay, as it ſeemeth he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not Latin well. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath <hi>ſportulantes fratres</hi> in a certeine Epiſtle. this he<note n="3" place="margin">2. reply. tract. elderſhip.</note> imagined to be brethren of the basket, where it may appeare <hi>Cyprian</hi> mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will not ſpeake of his ſtile, that is ſo hard and rough, and ſo ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with farre fetched, and out ſtretched metaphors.

               <p>As for the charge of diſloyaltie, I doe not thinke, that I haue ſimply and directly layd it vpon <hi>M.

               <p>¶ The anſwere.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ſeeme, that <hi>Iob Thr.</hi> who (I thinke) was the rude author of this vnpoliſhed &amp; vnciuill preface, would very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take ſome aduantage of my vnaduiſed dealing (as he taketh it) with <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> to cleere himſelfe: as if that which I ſayd againſt him were nothing, becauſe it is not true, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, that I bring againſt <hi>M. Cartwright.</hi> but it will not be. This therefore is to be put among the reſt of his odde, or rather madde concluſions, which in his moody paſſion he frameth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all mood and figure. his argument ſtandeth vpon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and therefore hath no good ſequele. for he that ſpeaketh vntrueth in one thing, may well ſpeake trueth in other things; and although a man ſhoulde vnciuilly demeane himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one; yet doth it not follow, that he ſhould doe it againſt all. for if that were granted, then were not <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> and <hi>Iob Throk.</hi> to be credited in any thing, vttering ſo manifolde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truethes in many things. nor were they to be ſo well accounted
<pb facs="tcp:21141:27"/>of among their conſorts, that haue ſo miſdemeaned themſelues againſt the Prelates of this Church, &amp; diuers other honeſt men.</p>
               <p>To let the aduantage of the bad ſequele of this argument go, I will not ſticke to grant <hi>M. Throk.</hi> this fauour, that my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> be taken as a patterne of the reſt of my writings. ſuch is the aſſurance of my plaine, and honeſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him, and of his bad dealing &amp; miſdemeanors againſt the ſtate. God is my witneſſe I haue not charged him wittingly with vntrueth, nor dealt vnconſcionably with him: and that I hope to make good either by <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> owne wordes, or by euident and ſufficient proofes. and ſo not onely M. <hi>Throk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortons</hi> cauſe will ſtill lie in the ſuddes, but M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> alſo will winne ſmall grace by his calumnious, and erroneous briefe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, there is no ſmall difference betwixt M. <hi>Carwright</hi> and M. <hi>Iob Throkmorton.</hi> he is a man not vnlearned nor vnciuil, nor furious: M. <hi>Iob</hi> is neither well learned, nor ſtayd, nor wiſe. but be he what he will, I will, by Gods helpe, iuſtifie my doings to be farre more charitable, iuſt, and honeſt, then either his, or M. <hi>Cartwrights.</hi> how well they are able to cleere themſelues of vnconſcionable, and vnhoneſt practiſes, doth partly appeare by that which is ſayd againſt <hi>Iob Throk.</hi> and he can not anſwere; and partly ſhall more appeare in this Treatiſe, againſt M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and as oft as they ſhall dare to ſtand vpon their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and puritan innocency. Neither haue I, as he leudly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, taken things hand ouer head, or raſhly ſpoken what I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but with good reaſon &amp; deliberation, and that according to good dealing, and a good conſcience. for proofe whereof, I appeale, not onely to all iudicious and in different readers, but alſo to M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> owne weake diſcourſe; wherein, either in effect hee confeſſeth as much as I ſay; or els can not prooue that I haue done him wrong. Wherefore let theſe vnciuill termes of vntrue, and diſhoneſt, and vnconſcionable dealing, and ſuch like, be eſteemed as the froth of the foule mouth of an angry and clamorous aduerſary, that hath more malice in his ſtomacke then wit in his head, and more audaciouſneſſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, then power to proue, or cauſe to vtter. Of M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> giftes I will not diſpute. of his honeſt cariage, I will reaſon no more then I am vrged to; and that in his proper place.</p>

               <p>¶ The anſwere.</p>
               <p>All this is nothing, but a vaine declamation of an idle felow to exhort men to patience. wherein the author pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe far better, then he contenteth others. For what, I pray you, maketh this to purpoſe, how patiently or impatiently this ſect doeth heare their faults reprooued? <hi>It is written,</hi> ſaieth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fator, <hi>of</hi> Socrates. but where I pray you? forſooth no where, ſaue in this preface, or in ſome ſuch like trifling ballade or pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. For <hi>Socrates</hi> was not led to execution, as this felow, that hath the feare of the gibbet ſtill before his eies, imagineth; but died of poiſon in his owne houſe, as<note n="1" place="margin">Iudic. Socrat.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> and other witneſſe: who make no mention of the houling of his wife, vpon which this ſuppoſed diſcourſe is grounded.</p>
               <p>He telleth vs further, <hi>how the ſpeach of</hi> Socrates <hi>ſhallriſe vp in iudgement</hi> againſt many puritans: which is a very ſtrange caſe. for if ſpeeches riſe vp, beware of M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> replies, that are ſo full of wordes without matter, and are light like bladders full of wind, and likely to flie ſarre abroad. The reſt of this diſcourſe is an idle digreſſion, wherein the author falleth into a fooliſh chafe with thoſe, that fret when they are falſly accuſed; and is
<pb facs="tcp:21141:29"/>angry that all his conſorts are not ſo patient as was <hi>Anna, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Paul,</hi> and other of Gods ſeruants. but he hath no reaſon. for his felowes bee liker to railing <hi>Shimei,</hi> and ſuch malcontents as <hi>Shibah,</hi> or <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> or like <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> For ſo theſe men would haue vs all to worſhip and fall downe before their church-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, which are nothing but a packe of golden calfes like thoſe of Bethel, &amp; would turne men from a ſetled ſtate to ſeeke a new church diſcipline, as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> turned the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael from the ſeruice of God, to embrace a newe worſhip in Bethel.</p>
               <p>Further he exhorteth all that loue the elderſhip, to ſuffer falſe reproches patiently. yet I know none that reprocheth them falſly. nor doeth <hi>Iob Throkmorton</hi> ceaſe whining, albeit he can ſay nothing for himſelfe, nor can M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> keepe ſilence, albeit he would ſeeme patient, as appeareth by his briefe. euill therefore doeth this exhortation ſit in this mans mouth.</p>
               <p>He doeth alſo exhort men, <hi>not to ſuffer as malefactors:</hi> but this commeth ſomewhat to late. for <hi>Iohn Penry</hi> and diuers of his conſorts haue ſuffred as malefactors already. For anſwere of the reſt of this ſection, I referre you to the notes in the margent of the text: a woorthie anſwere for ſuch vaine wordes.</p>

But if they refuſe to ſtand to law, and wil ſtill rage and raile againſt the eccleſiaſticall ſtate: rather will chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren throw ſtones at them as againſt mad men, then wiſe men paſſe any white ſtone of abſolution on their ſide. As for my part, I haue not written any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the cauſe of this church, whereof I need to ſtand in doubt as they haue done. Wherefore the prefator may doe wel to turne his ſpeach to his friends, that percaſe may hearken to his aduiſe, and folow it. He knoweth, that in this cauſe I am his aduerſarie, and am well acquainted with his folly; wherein I leaue the man ſtill rauing like thoſe that caſt ſtones into the aire, and ſo proceed.</p>

               <p>¶ The anſwere.</p>
               <p>Of all the gueſtes that come to the ſynoddicall meetings, &amp; houſes of theſe ſectaries, there is no greater ſtranger, then this gueſt called Good conſcience, that he talketh of. for neither in their publike writings againſt the church, and chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof, nor in their priuate negotiations and contracts, doe they (for any thing I can learne) vſe either good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or good dealing. Other good fellowes there are, that doe frequent their houſes more often, as pride, diſdaine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, enuie, hatred, detraction, lying, oppreſſion, follie, furie, and ſuch like, with which they are better acquainted. but it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter to hide ſoule matters vnder faire wordes. Wolues are diſguiſed oft times in ſheeps clothing: and poyſon is ſometimes giuen in honie: <hi>Impia ſub dulci melle venena latent.</hi> Take heed therefore of malcontents, that cut mens throtes with their good conſcience: and doe not ſtraight thinke, that theſe men loue her mateſtie, for that they make ſuch gloſing and flattering prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. it may be, <hi>in ore mel, in corde fel.</hi> All men honour the ſunne in the midſt of the firmament, but when night commeth, they fall on ſleepe and forget all. And of them wee may truely ſay, <hi>That they flattered with their mouth &amp; diſſembled with their tongue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.</note> 
                  <hi>but their heart is not vpright.</hi> for if theſe kind of men had truely loued her maieſtie, and from their heart prayed for her, they would not haue prayed for her in ſpirit only, as this man would haue his conſortes to doe, but expreſſed their affection in their words: they would alſo in their prayers as other good ſubiects doe, haue expreſſed and giuen to her, her due ſtile. they would not haue couertly and cunningly taken from her all power in eccleſiaſtical gouemment, as they haue done, not once ſo much as mentioning either her, or her roiall authoritie in their booke of holy and ſynoddicall diſcipline, to which <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> and many others ſubſcribed, they would not haue impugned her lawes, and by right and wrong ſought to haue altered her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and to haue eſtabliſhed new lawes and orders in this church. they would not haue diſgraced that bleſſed reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which wee doe enioy by her meanes, neither would<note n="1" place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21141:30"/>in their duties toward God. neither would <hi>M. Cart.</hi> haue made her maieſtie and all princes ſubiect to the elderſhip. which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but for the ſupremacie of the Pope, to bring in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of the elderſhip, and (as he<note n="1" place="margin">2. part 2. reply, pag. 65. &amp; 92.</note> ſaieth) to make princes <hi>to licke the dust of their feete.</hi> ſo that where we had wel hoped that we had bene deliuered from kiſſing the Popes feete, they would make vs not onely to kiſſe the feete of a packe of baſe pezants and artizans, but alſo to licke the duſt vnder their feete. Much (I doe know) they doe brag of their loialtie and good minds. but giue me the heart, and let them leaue their glorious wordes. What ſeruice at any time haue they done her maieſtie at home or abroad, in armes or in peace, in the church or common wealth? nay rather where haue they not bene readie to<note n="2" place="margin">

Which fault to amend, let vs deſire God not onely to ſhield her from her open enemies, but alſo to diſcouer all her diſſembling friends, and to gard her from their trecherous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and lewd diſgraces; that ſhe may bee no leſſe victorious ouer her open foes, then ſecured from her pretended friends. But enough of this malicious, and yet moſt worthleſſe &amp; grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe preface. Let vs now come to <hi>M.

The Prologue tolde vs of a man that ſhould play innocency, and come in armed with patience: but M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> that ſhould doe the feat, faileth in both: for neither doth he deale iuſtly, as becommeth innocency; nor patiently, as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with patience.

               <p>And yet notwithſtanding both his owne guiltineſſe &amp; mine innocency M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> as I perceiue, meant to charge me with ſlanders, and that not onely <hi>in breach of neceſſary duties, but in things indifferent alſo,</hi> as he ſayth. a matter very ſtrange, and new, and to expreſſe them liuely, like to his fancie of diſcipline: that is, fantaſticall, and very abſurd. for neither is the breach of duty the obiect of ſlander, nor doe reports in things indifferent bring infamy, but ſo long hath the man beene ſtriuing about things indifferent, as he calleth them, that he knoweth not the difference of things ſimply euill, or abſolutely good or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Beſide that, he ſhall finde by particulars, that either I doe not obiect the matters which he would inforce vpon me, or that I do prooue them ſufficiently. Wherefore, vnleſſe his eſtate, of which he here ſpeaketh, be greater then I do imagine, it will be no ſlander to tell him, that his diuiſion of ſlaunders, and firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into his purpoſe is very rude and ſimple: and that hee doth me wrong to challenge me either for ſlander or wrong of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him. and that ſhall appeare, by the grace of God, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout this whole diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing wherein hee chargeth me to haue ſlaundered him, <hi>is conſpiracie with</hi> Hacket <hi>and</hi> Copinger: a matter, that I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſauow. Why then doth hee not iuſtifie his charge, and bring in his proofes? in the places which he quoteth in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to <hi>Throkmortons</hi> letter, there is no ſuch matter. Nay, I do not ſo much as name conſpiracie in reſpect of his dealings with them. if any do charge him, it is his owne guilty conſcience, that doth charge him, and his foltring tongue that runneth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe vnawares vpon the truth. for mine owne part, I do neither charge him, nor can I diſcharge him. good dealing therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that he ſhould haue ſet downe my wordes as I wrote them, and not thus falſely to forge odious matters, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
<pb facs="tcp:21141:33"/>them. is this the ſincerity hee profeſſeth? is this the good dealing wee are to expect at his hands? and doth hee thinke to diſcharge himſelfe, or win credit by this dealing? <hi>Praetor edixit,</hi> ſayth<note n="19" place="margin">Prator. ff. de iniuriis.</note>

               <p>Thus you haue heard M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> long anſwere to a ſhort matter. or rather an anſwere abounding with words, &amp; deuoid of all good matter, and (to ſay as you ſhall finde it by examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſo vnſufficient and diſioynted, as that I doubt not, but if my wordes were rightly ſet downe, and not either cut ſhorter, or made longer as a certeine tyrant did his vnwelcome gueſtes, his owne anſwere would cleare me both of ſlander, and iniurie.</p>
               <p>The firſt exception therefore that I may iuſtly take to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, is this, that he omitteth, &amp; dare not ſet downe the words of my bookes, wherein he taketh himſelfe to be charged. the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that he anſwereth not to theſe matters, wherewith hee ſaieth he is charged. the third is, that he forgeth matters neuer meant nor intended by me. the laſt is, that hee miſplaceth my words, and peruerteth my meaning, and yet anſwereth nothing ſufficient to cleare himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is prooued by the words that folow: In my anſwere to the petition of the diſciplinarians I demanded this queſtion,<note place="margin">Pag. 197.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether</hi> M.

                  <hi>engaged in</hi> Hackets <hi>and</hi> Copingers <hi>cauſe conferring both by word and writing, and conſenting (as it ſeemeth) to his deuiſe for the deliuerance of himſelfe and other his companions then in priſon:</hi> he leaueth out the wordes, <hi>as it ſeemeth,</hi> and addeth this worde, <hi>communication:</hi> and where I ſay, <hi>he ſeemed to conſent to his deuiſe concerning the deliuerance of the priſoners,</hi> he would haue it, that I ſimply charge him with conſenting to all his conſpiracie. ſuch manifeſt force muſt hee offer to my wordes, before hee could make any ſhew of anſwere. yea, &amp; when he hath done all this, what doeth he anſwere that may ſatisfie either his friends or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies concerning theſe matters?</p>
               <p>I ſayd in effect hee had intelligence of <hi>Hackets</hi> and <hi>Copingers</hi> practiſes, and liked them as far as they pretended the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his conſiſtorian diſcipline, albeit I will not ſay, he knew the particulers of the courſe they meant to holde.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21141:36"/>laſtly by M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> owne confeſſion. <hi>From you,</hi> ſaith<note n="1" place="margin">In his letter to <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 24. of Febr.</note> 
                  <hi>Copinger</hi> to his reuerend friend M. <hi>Cartwright, I receiued this meſſage, that I ſhould attempt nothing, but by aduiſe of thoſe, which you would procure to counſellme.</hi> Afterward he deſireth, <hi>that mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day being appointed by</hi> M. Cartwright <hi>for conference might holde,</hi> M. <hi>Throkmorton</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">In his letter to a certeine Lady.</note> ſaith, <hi>that hauing recouered himſelfe, he ſignified to</hi> M. Cartwright <hi>in the Fleete what had paſſed betwixt</hi> M. Copin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>and himſelfe.</hi> How then could hee be ignorant of matters, hauing ſuch a good intelligencer as M. <hi>Throkmorton,</hi> who knew whatſoeuer paſſed? M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in this anſwere confeſſeth how M. <hi>Hockenhul</hi> caried diuers meſſages betwixt himſelfe and <hi>Copinger,</hi> and one letter alſo of <hi>Copingers</hi> to him. Likewiſe that he knew how <hi>Copinger</hi> meant to diſcouer certeine horrible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (as he pretended) to her Maieſtie, and what the particulers thereof were. which argueth, that M. <hi>Copinger</hi> would conceale nothing from his louing and reuerend friend (as he calleth him) M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all this what anſwereth M. <hi>Cartwright?</hi> he ſaith, firſt <hi>that heneuer ſaw</hi> Hacket <hi>to his knowledge, nor yet</hi> Arthington <hi>vntill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his impriſonment.</hi> But what then? haue not many enterteined practiſes of treaſon, and rebellion with the Pope, and Spaniſh king, that neuer ſaw their perſons? it ſufficeth that they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued letters, meſſages, or meanes from them. the which courſe M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> held in his buſines likewiſe. for albeit hee knewe not <hi>Hacket</hi> nor <hi>Arthington,</hi> yet he confeſſeth hee was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Copinger,</hi> and receiued meſſages from him by M. <hi>Hoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhull.</hi> The parts therefore of this anſwere are like the of ſpring of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> which killed one another. Beſides the confeſſion, it muſt be remembred, that <hi>Iob. Throkmorton</hi> brought intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from <hi>Copinger</hi> to M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> Laſtly M. <hi>Copinger</hi> doeth write very familiarly to M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and ſaith in effect, <hi>that although hee might not come to him without danger to both, yet deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be approoued of him, promiſing to declare to him, or ſuch as hee ſhould appoint, both generalities and particularities, ſo farre as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to looke into them.</hi> For before that, he wrote, <hi>that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a courſe that was likely to bring danger to himſelfe.</hi> If then M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> refuſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre with <hi>Copinger,</hi> or to receiue letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, it was only for feare of approching too nere to danger.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21141:37"/>
               <p>Secondly, he alleageth for himſelfe, <hi>that albeit he was in deed acquainted with</hi> Edmund Copinger, <hi>and had aſſoiled the ſayd</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund <hi>two questions propounded to him by M.</hi> Hockenhull, <hi>and had receiued a meſſage from him firſt, and afterward ſeene a letter of</hi> Copingers <hi>written vnto him: yet he anſwered the queſtions little to</hi> Copingers <hi>fatiſfaction; and that he would neither receiue his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, nor read his letters;</hi> And further, <hi>that he diſſwaded</hi> Edm. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger <hi>from his frantike conceits by M.</hi> Hockenhull, <hi>and gaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the counteſſe of Warwike, that M.</hi> Copinger <hi>whereas hee ment to diſcouer certaine treaſons to her maieſtie, was not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as a man ouertaken with ſtrange conceits of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie calling.</hi> But all this is either vnlikely, or els maketh nothing for <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> clearing. for albeit he might make ſhew by <hi>M. Hockenhull</hi> to diſſuade <hi>Copinger</hi> from his courſe, &amp; ſeemed to reiect his conference, and his letters: yet in truth his meaning was onely to keepe himſelfe from danger, and not to breake of <hi>Copingers</hi> pretended enterpriſe. for that doeth <hi>Copinger</hi> plainly affirme, and reaſon confirme. For firſt <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> anſwere concerning extraordinarie callings not ſo ceaſed, but that in the waſt of the Church they might haue place, did ſtirre vp him to thinke, that diſcipline which <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> compareth to a wall and hedge being wanting, this church admitteth ſuch callings. yea, and <hi>Copinger</hi> himſelfe<note n="1" place="margin">In a letter to <hi>M. Charke.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith, <hi>that it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but the waste of the church is great, and that there was place for extraordinarie men.</hi> Secondly, if <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> meant to haue delt peremptorily: he might eaſily haue cut <hi>Copinger</hi> ſhort by publiſhing his follies, and giuing warning to all his folowers to auoyd him, but to doe that was not for his profite. Laſtly, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he gaue ſome notice to the counteſſe of Warwike of the mans weakeneſſe; yet was it not ſuch as ſtopped his courſe, which he might haue done, if he would haue told all.</p>
               <p>That theſe things which <hi>M. Cartw.</hi> telleth vs, are vnlikely, it partly appeareth by <hi>Copingers</hi> letters, who reſted ſatiſfied with <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> meſſages; which otherwiſe he would not haue done: and partly by the dealing of <hi>Throkmorton,</hi> and <hi>P. Went. M. Egert.</hi> and others, who ſtill delt with <hi>Copinger,</hi> with whom if M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> had refuſed to deale, they would haue ſhunned him as a ſerpent. Further the ſame is prooued by M. <hi>Hockenhuls</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21141:37"/>who would not haue come ſo often from him with letters and meſſage, if he had bene a man frantike, or light hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and caſt off by M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> Againe, the ſame is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> owne wordes, and confeſſion. for if hee had thought him vnworthy to be talked with, he would not ſo often haue heard of him, nor ſent him ouer to be conferred with all by others. Laſtly, that <hi>Copinger</hi> was neither frantike, nor ſo accounted of, appeareth by his well written letters, by his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, by his ſober behauior, by his cunning practiſes, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the opinion of<note n="1" place="margin">He calleth <hi>Edm. Copinger</hi> his deare brother.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob Throk.</hi> and <hi>P.W.</hi> that wrote to him as a man of ſome note among that ſect. neither ſeemeth hee to haue other folly, then the common folly of puritans, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe not vnwiſe, yet hold frantike &amp; fooliſh opinions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he ſaieth, that <hi>if he had bene guiltie and not detected of theſe matters, that either the commiſſioners in that cauſe had not vſed diligence or faithfull dealing therein.</hi> which is a very diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſurmiſe againſt men of ſuch honour, and no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth for M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> purpoſe. for we may not thinke, but that they ſaw both <hi>Wiggingtons</hi> and M. <hi>Cartwrights,</hi> and others dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and were notwithſtanding content with the puniſhment of the chiefe heads of that conſpiracie. Beſides that, time that bringeth matters to knowledge, hath declared things that then lay hid, and <hi>Iob Throkmorton</hi> and M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> themſelues haue told tales.</p>
               <p>His laſt argument to prooue his innocencie, is this, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington cannot accuſe him of theſe matters.</hi> which is rather a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous conceit, then a ſound argument. for thoſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage any ſuch wicked plot, do not make all their partakers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all their ſecrets.</p>
               <p>Neither doeth he auoyd ſuch matters as may bee alleaged to iuſtifie ſo much, as I ſayd againſt him. nay, he doeth not onely miſtake my obiection, but the reaſons alſo. He ſaieth, that <hi>the firſt reaſon of my accuſations was drawen from his conference.</hi> yet I doe not accuſe M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> nor doe I obiect that which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, nor doe I reaſon as he ſaieth. yet if to prooue that <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> had intelligence of <hi>Copingers</hi> matters I ſayd, there did letters and meſſages paſſe betwixt them, it is no bad reaſon, nor is it anſwered.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21141:38"/>
               <p>Neither doe I ſay, becauſe they ſalted together, that M. <hi>Cart.</hi> was guiltie of <hi>Copingers</hi> practiſes. yet if they faſted and prayed together <hi>that God would giue good ſucceſſe to the matters then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> it is not likely but M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> vnderſtood what was intended; for who doeth pray for ſuch things, as hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhould reaſon ridiculouſly to ſay, that <hi>euery one whom the traitors named and prayſed, were priuie to their treaſons.</hi> I would therefore wiſh that M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> would ſhew, where I do thus reaſon, as he doeth charge me. yet if I ſhould ſay, that M. <hi>Cart.</hi> did ſo demeane and cary himſelf, hat theſe traitors ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they had great intereſt in him, and therefore prayſed him ſo highly; I thinke I ſhould not ſay amiſſe. Further methinkes it is ſome fault to giue occaſion, as he hath done to the Baroiſts, and theſe Hacketians thus furiouſly to oppugne the church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doeth S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">De eiuit. Dei, lib. <hi>20.</hi> &amp; <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> ſay, that the laſt iudgement is defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that heretikes and ſchiſmatikes that hurt after their death by their actions, writings, and examples, may receiue puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to their demerites. But ſaieth M. <hi>Cartwr. their prayſe was exceſſiue, and I am not woorthy to beare the bookes after many that liue in this age, yea, and in this church of our land.</hi> A goodly matter, and woorthie to be noted! as if any did either charge him, or ſuppoſe him to be ſo admirably well learned; or as if that were the queſtion here, and not rather; what mad conceit theſe mad fellowes had of him. Hee ſaieth therefore further, that <hi>they commended him as he was firſt, and not as he was now:</hi> A matter that I neuer heard before this, nor can beleeue. for <hi>Copinger</hi> did ſtill ſpeake of him with reuerence: and all that euer heard the wordes as farre as I can learne, ſay as I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. But whether it bee ſo, or no; ſufficient it is, that theſe traitors had ſuch a great conceit of his writings which he doeth auowe; and many doe very well like, and theſe traitors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as ſetting foorth the groundes of thoſe things, for which they did ſtriue, and in tumultuous ſort ſeeke to winne them. My report therefore is very right, and <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> by his fauour is fowly either miſtaken, or in his owne ginnes taken.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſayth he, <hi>M.</hi> Sutcliffe <hi>concludeth, that I was a medler
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21141:38"/>in theſe matters, vpon aduantage of certeine words of a letter of one</hi> Iohn Bowman <hi>of Oundle.</hi> true. but neither doth this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amount ſo farre, as M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> would force it, (for I doe not there conclude, that he conſented to <hi>Copinger,</hi> as he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) nor can he deny, but that my reaſon is good to ſhew him to be a buſie medler in theſe cauſes. therefore doth he anſwere firſt, <hi>that he neuer wrote to M.</hi> Wiggington <hi>in his life to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi> as if many things of his come not from him by his ſeruants and frends, which he neuer wrote, and as if it were not his practiſe to deale all by third perſons, as appeareth in this matter of his with <hi>Copinger.</hi> Hee anſwerreth therefore further, <hi>that it might be ſome writing of the Court matters in the Starcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> as if M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> or any els were ſo ſimple, that he could not diſtinguiſh the Court from the Starre chamber. Now that this writing ſhould come to <hi>Wiggintons</hi> hands, and at ſuch time as <hi>Hacket</hi> was with him, it is a plaine preſumption, that M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> had ſome intereſt in <hi>Wigginton</hi> and <hi>Hacket,</hi> and theſe two in him: vnleſſe he would haue vs ſurmiſe, that all happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by chance without any purpoſe of his, and that the Court matters <hi>Bowman</hi> ſpeaketh of were rather concerning the ciuill ſtate then their diſciplinarian cauſes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if we conſider <hi>Copingers</hi> letters to M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> that doe plainely argue the approbation of his purpoſe, though percaſe not the particular meanes for feare of himſelfe; and alſo M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> anſwere of extraordinary callings not ceaſed now, eſpecially in the ruines of the Church, which <hi>Copinger</hi> tooke as granted; and the meſſages ſent to and fro by M. <hi>Hoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhull</hi>

               <p>Yet he ſaith, <hi>I do inſinuate that he boaſteth of miracles.</hi> and why? becauſe he ſayth <hi>the brethren would not els like of them.</hi> a worthy reaſon! for if <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> did boaſt of all things which his fancifull followers doe like of, he ſhould boaſt of more vanities and fooleries, then he hath haires of his head. further, <hi>he would haue the towne examined, wherein he dwelleth, whether any voice did euer come from him by way of boaſting of his miracles.</hi> as if it were not anoyance enough to examine his vaine anſweres, but we muſt examine all his fantaſticall diſciples, yea and others to. or as if his followers might not giue out, that hee is an holy man, and worketh miracles, and yet he not able to worke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracle, then as iuglers doe, that make all that behold them wonder, when they doe nothing but play a litle legierde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe he will needes haue me examine the matter, I haue bene content to doe him this fauour: and doe find that in deed, albeit I haue not hitherto ſayd ſo much, yet hee hath not onely boaſted, but alſo moſt vainly boaſted of his miracles, if we may beleeue his hearers, for they ſay that one<note n="1" place="margin">Teſtified by diuers honeſt men in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike.</note> 
                  <hi>Chaplin</hi> of Warwike being taken ſicke in the hall of the hoſpitall, where M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> contrary to lawes of hoſpitalitie had reuelled at him, and threatened Gods iudgement againſt him for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed drunkenneſſe; he not long after the mans death going vp into the pulpit, and taking the hiſtorie of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira Act.</hi> 5. for his text, did there ſay, <hi>that</hi> Chaplin <hi>was ſtriken, as was Ananias and Saphira.</hi> which is nothing els but to compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to make the death of <hi>Chaplin</hi> no leſſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, then the death of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> Onely this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be all the difference, that <hi>Peter</hi> did not raſhly iudge of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphiraes</hi> death, nor declare them vnwoorthy of buriall, whereas M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> did, as <hi>Chaplins</hi> wel willers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, thunder out his deteſtations againſt <hi>Chaplin</hi> being dead, and ſaid he was vnworthy of chriſtian buriall. ſuch is the mans chriſtian modeſtie and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>In the end, to make all ſure, he deſireth <hi>that when the legend of his miracles ſhall come forth, there may be for the credite of him that ſetteth it foorth, the names of the reporters, &amp; likewiſe of the brethren laid down, that are guiltie of this dotage.</hi> Wherein I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21141:40"/>what he hath to doe, to accuſe others of dotage, eſpecially his owne deare friendes, hauing nothing to anſwere for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He doeth not ſay, whether about Warwike he hath not heard reportes of his miracles: nor doeth he tell vs, that he hath condemned ſuch reports, or denied that he can worke miracles. but would haue thoſe condemned of dotage, that meane to ſet foorth the legend of them. yet neither haue I ſayd that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth miracles, nor can I beleeue any ſuch matter. This is in deed his owne folly, that ridiculouſly gloried as they ſay, in the death of <hi>Chaplin;</hi> and of his folowers, that beleeue that in trueth hee can worke miracles. for that is the ſpeach of his credulous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples about Warwike: and I my ſelfe haue heard thoſe that ſtoutly haue maintained ſo much to my face. and that firſt for the ſtrange death of <hi>Chaplin.</hi> Secondly, for that one<note n="1" place="margin">Theſe matters of <hi>Browne</hi> and <hi>Harris</hi> will be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: and I thinke himſelfe will not deny that there is ſuch a report.</note> 
                  <hi>Browne</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after that M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> had denounced Gods iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for denying that he had begot his mayd with child: and yet his wife and others ſay, the poore man was impotent &amp; vnable to doe it. Thirdly, for that one <hi>Harris</hi> being threatened with Gods wrath by M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> not long after languiſhed and died. But the man was a weake felow, and being for diſpleaſure and becauſe hee was no friend to M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> diſcipline, by one <hi>Dulhams</hi> meanes preſſed foorth for a ſoldier, died for feare and griefe, as they ſay: where note by the way that all the report of M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> miracles conſiſteth in the diſcouraging, &amp; killing of poore chriſtians. therefore doeth he well to deny, that hee doeth worke miracles. for this is nothing but miraculous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, which they report of him: and I am much to thanke him, that taketh my part againſt thoſe, that doe make him a ſaint, &amp; a great worker of miracles, and that denieth all the legend that goeth through the hands of ſimple people which by his fained holineſſe, and ſtrange grimaces, and pretenſed geſtures, haue bene deceiued.</p>
               <p>But did he worke miracles, or not; how vnaduiſedly hath he in this place made ſuch outcries of ſlaunder vpon my wordes? where is the ſlander? and how is it prooued? is it not a miracle that M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> ſhould thus fowly be miſtaken? let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare what the law faieth; <hi>He that bringeth his action of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious or ſlaunderous ſpeaches,</hi>

               </q>
               <p>Matth. Sutcliffe.</p>
               <p>Behold I beſeech you a hainous ſlander, for which not onely <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> but the whole conſociation of Puritans is grieuouſly ſcandalized. I ſaid, <hi>that</hi> M. Cartwright <hi>refuſed to anſwere direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being examined in the Starre-chamber.</hi> Well, what ſaith <hi>M. Cartwright?</hi> doth not he confeſſe as much, as I ſaid? he cannot deny it. His words are plaine. <hi>I refuſed it,</hi> ſaith he. but if he had not confeſſed it, yet would the record in the Starre-chamber haue conuinced him. Now then, when himſelfe confeſſeth, and the record teſtifieth as much as I ſay, how happeneth it, that his owne wordes are ſo cleare, and mine reputed ſcandalouſe? or why ſhould not hee aſwell be thought to ſlander himſelfe, as I, ſeeing he confeſſeth that very matter, which I do obiect? <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I refuſed it, as impertinent.</hi> as if that were materiall for what cauſe he refuſed it, the queſtion being onely whether hee refuſed it, or no. But to take away all excuſe, it ſhalbe proued, that it was very pertinent, for firſt, what more pertinent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince him of notorious diſloyaltie, then to ſhew that hee had a bad conceit of diuers points of her Maieſties ſupreme authoritie? Beſide that, iudge (I pray you) whether euery one is not bound to yeeld an anſwere to his ſuperiors in all matters that touch his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21141:41"/>alleagiance. Laſt of al, it cannot be ſurmiſed, that ſo honourable and wiſe Lords and Iudges would require anſwere to matters impertinent; neither if it were impertinent, had M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> reaſon afterward to anſwere it, as he did.</p>
               <p>Therefore to make his matter moſt cleare, he ſaith, <hi>hee hath bene ſworne fiue or ſixe times to her Maieſties ſupremacy, and is</hi>

                  <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ready to take the othe, if any doubt bee made of his iudgement therein.</hi> As if there were any queſtion of other matter, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he once refuſed to anſwere concerning matters of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſupremacie, or no. Beſide that, diuers Papiſts haue bene often ſworne, that now are of a contrary opinion: yea and ſome of them pretend readineſſe to take the othe, yea and take it, but with thoſe qualifications, and interpretations, that do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie their bad minds. According to the meaning of the ſtatute I thinke he will not take the oath. for then he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the Queene hath power to eſtabliſh and diſanull Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall lawes, to appoint Eccleſiaſticall Iudges, officers and commiſſioners, to heare appeales or to appoint delegates to heare them when they are made from Eccleſiaſticall courtes, to nominate Biſhops, to receiue firſt fruits and tenthes of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall liuings, and ſuch like rights &amp; priuiledges, as the ſtatutes of this land giue her. but that he may not, nor (I thinke) wil not do, for that the lawes of their diſcipline deny it. if ſo be he would, I confeſſe, he ſhould ſatisfie me in this point: but hee ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruinate the foundation of his aldermens conſiſtoriall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to whom they giue moſt of theſe things. Yea &amp; I doubt, whether others would be ſatisfied. for as in religion it is a note of an hereticall diſpoſition, to doubt of the grounds of our faith; ſo in policie it is a note of a diſloyall perſon, to doubt of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lawfull authoritie, which the ſtatutes giue her. In which caſe ſeeing you were once, albeit now you vtterly deny it; I pray you let vs not haue you too much boaſt of your innocencie, and that in ſuch long Prefaces, as that before your ſhort briefe: eſpecially ſeeing heretofore you haue written and done many things to the praeiudice of her ſupremacie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes.</p>
               <p>In the booke of your holy diſcipline, wherein you hold, <hi>that a perfect forme of Church gouernment, ſuch as is preſcribed in Gods word, is conteined,</hi> you haue vtterly excluded the princes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb facs="tcp:21141:42"/>and debarred him from all gouernment. for you haue not ſo much as mentioned him.</p>
               <p>In one of the diſciplinarian bookes of common prayer,<note n="1" place="margin">This booke they ſought to haue confirmed by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and adminiſtration of Sacraments you leaue out the Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, in another there is ſome mention made of him, but it is in the ende of the booke, and after all the officers of the Church deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in direct termes you ſay, <hi>that the Chriſtian magistrate can no more be an officer of the Church,</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">2. reply. p. 420.</note> 
                  <hi>then the paſtors can bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</hi> how then can he be ſupreme gouernor of the Church, that is no gouernor at all,<note n="3" place="margin">2. repl. 2. parl. p. 147.</note> as you ſay? You hold alſo, <hi>that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrate hath no more authoritie in the Church, then a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then prince.</hi> which is ſufficient to exclude him out of the Church gouernment. Finally <hi>you do ſubiect him to the excommunication of your elderſhips, and place the magiſtrate among thoſe that are to obey, and the elders among commanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly you wil not deny, but that the Papiſts deny her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſupremacie in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall. how then can it be ſaid, that you hold a good opinion of it, when you in your books do giue her no more authoritie then they, and abridge the ſame as farre as they doe?<note n="4" place="margin">2. repl. p. 48.</note> Doe you not deny, <hi>that the prince ought to be called the head of particuler and viſible Churches within his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> Do you not likewiſe<note n="5" place="margin">Ibidem p. 157. &amp; 167.</note> take from him <hi>authoritie to determine of Church cauſes,</hi> and<note n="6" place="margin">1. reply p. 192.</note>

They ſubiect the prince to the Pope, you to your elderſhips, neither can you ſhew any other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your ſelfes, and them. For where you ſay firſt, <hi>that you doe not exempt your miniſters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the puniſhment of the ciuil magiſtrate, as the Papiſts doe their Prieſtes,</hi> you erre in both. for both would you claime immunitie for your miniſters, and they do not ſimply exempt their prieſtes, but in certeine caſes. The authors of the<note n="7" place="margin">Admonition 2. p. 65.</note> admonition would haue <hi>themſelues and their companions by act of Parliament exempted from the authoritie of Iustices, and from their enditings and finings.</hi> In your<note n="8" place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> reply, <hi>you would haue the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ciuill magiſtrate to deſcend from Chriſt, as God,</hi> and <hi>not as mediator;</hi> whereof it followeth, that Chriſtian princes haue no rule ouer their ſubiects as Chriſtians, but onely as men;

               <p>Secondly you ſay, <hi>that the Papiſts will haue the prince to execute whatſoeuer they conclude, be it good or bad; which you will not.</hi> For you graunt the prince <hi>authoritie to ſet order where there is no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſtery, and to ſtay vnlawfull decrees of lawfull ministers.</hi> As if the<note n="8" place="margin">Hard. confus. apol. p. <hi>304.</hi> &amp; <hi>317.</hi>
                  </note> Papiſts did not grant as much: or as if Papiſts held, that the princes were to execute wicked decrees. Againe it is euident that you would haue all men to ſtand to the<note n="9" place="margin">Admonit.</note> determination of your ſynodes. And albeit your ſynodes doe decree bad things, yet you wil not giue princes authoritie to iudge them. How then can they ſtay them? will you giue them extraordinary authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? that is your meaning. But how ſhall wee know when they worke by ordinary, when by extraordinary authoritie? Beſide that, you deny this extraordinary authoritie as long, as there is a lawfull miniſtery. And albeit your doings be vnlawfull, yet you will not be ſtayed by the prince.</p>
               <p>Thirdly you<note n="10" place="margin">2. p. 164.</note> affirme, <hi>that you do not vtterly ſeclude the prince from your Churchaſſemblies. for oftentimes a ſimple man and (as the prouerbe ſaith) a gardner hath ſpoken to purpoſe.</hi> So you count the prince as a ſimple fellow, and as a poore gardener among the

               <p>Fiftly being demaunded by me, whether the diſciplinarians, whoſe leader and as it were oracle you are, do not in effect deny the principall points of her Maieſties ſupremacie, and take from her power to ordeine rites and orders for the Church, and right to nominate Biſhops, and to appoint Eccleſiaſticall commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to delegate learned men to heare the laſt appeale from Eccleſiaſticall courts, likewiſe authoritie to call and gouerne ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes, and other prerogatiues and rights giuen to the prince by the ſtatutes and lawes of England: and finally whether you doe not endeuour to bring in forreigne lawes &amp; iuriſdiction repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſtatutes of ſupremacie, and her Maieſties preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: you anſwere nothing. Which is nothing els, but a plaine confeſſion, that you dare not directly, and in plaine termes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your opinion concerning the foreſaid matters; and doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede abridge her Maieſtie of a great part of her royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly when you were called vpon your othe in the Starre-chamber to anſwere to diuers points of her ſupremacie, you ſhew your ſelfe to haue a peruerſe opinion, and therefore dare not anſwere directly. Being<note n="6" place="margin">Interrog. 3.</note> demanded <hi>whether you haue not taught or allowed, that the prince being neither pastour, nor elder, is to bee accompted among the gouernours of the Church, or among thoſe that are to be gouerned: and alſo whether in a well ordered Church he may ordeine orders and ceremonies therein:</hi> doe you not ſay for all anſwere, that you are not bound to anſwere? and do you not perſiſt therein? Now how can it be ſuppoſed, that you allow the prince to be ſupreme gouernor, that will not acknowledge him to be any gouernor of the Church at all? or howe can it be ſaid you allow the points of her Maieſties ſupremacie, that will not

                  <hi>Fecknam</hi>) <hi>offer my ſelfe to receiue a corporall othe vpon the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes, that I doe verily thinke and am perſwaded in my conſcience, that the Queenes highneſſe is the onely ſupreme gouernour of this Realme, and of all other her Maieſties dominions, &amp;c. and that ſhee hath vnder God the ſouereintie and rule ouer all maner perſons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and temporall.</hi> And yet he doeth not beleeue the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points of her Maieſties authoritie, nor acknowledge them. So likewiſe it may be, you will acknowledge her Maieſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in generall termes, and yet wil not acknowledge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall points of her authoritie.

               <p>In this anſwer there are two principall queſtions, that ſhould haue bene reſolued by M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> if he meant to conclude ought againſt me. the firſt is, whether he did highly commend M. <hi>Fenners</hi> booke or no, wherein this ſtrange poſition mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the title of his anſwere is conteined; the ſecond, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granting ſo much as I charged him withall, he was herein ſlandered, as in euery of his ſeuerall accuſations he pretendeth. of theſe two queſtions M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> reſolueth nether. with what face then can hee ſay, that he is ſlandered, not being able to deny any thing which I ſay, nor to iuſtifie his wrong imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlaunder? did hee thinke, that I ſhould neuer returne to looke into theſe matters? if he did, what hope hath he to make them good?</p>
               <p>Beſide this wrong, where I ſay <hi>that</hi> Fenner <hi>giueth authoritie to inferior perſons,</hi> as indeed he doth: he cunningly foiſteth in <hi>ſuperior perſons.</hi> as if either he meant to<note n="1" place="margin">If he ſay, that a prince may be ouerruled by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the princes ſouereignty. if in ſuch common wealths where the magiſtrates haue indeed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, he deny their authority, he ſpeaketh, as a man ignorant of antiquitie and ſtate.</note> denie the princes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, or their authoritie (if any ſuch may be) that haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer the prince or king; as the Romanes had ouer kings,
<pb facs="tcp:21141:45"/>that were their vaſſals and tributaries, of which wee talke not, nor make any queſtion. ſuch goodly diſcourſes maketh M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> all muffled about the eyes with the maske of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, ſo that he could ſee nothing, vnleſſe it were to miſalledge my words, and to anſwere nothing to purpoſe. yet leaſt his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and followers might thinke, he had ſayd great matters; let vs examine euen this nothing.</p>
               <p>He ſayth, <hi>that M.</hi> Fenner <hi>giueth no ſuch authority, as is ſayd, but where the lawes of the land doe eſtabliſh ſuch an authoritie as the Ephori in Lacedaemonia had.</hi> A matter, as I ſhewed, that made not to purpoſe, and which is alſo very falſe. for M. <hi>Fenner,</hi> as M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſhould not be ignorant, ſpeaketh of lawes drawn out of the word of God, to which all princes ought to ſubmit their ſcepters. further he ſpeaketh generally. he therefore that taketh it otherwiſe, doth both miſtake and miſconſtrue.</p>
               <p>Driuen from this ground hee flieth to the ſecond, and ſayth, <hi>that hee is not of M.</hi> Fenners <hi>iudgement.</hi> which ſitteth him not well to ſay, vnleſſe he will contradict himſelfe in his epiſtle. for the matters conteined in M. <hi>Fenners</hi> booke hee calleth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Fourthly, to preſſe mee downe with the authoritie of the Starre chamber, he goeth on, and yet <hi>leaueth it to be conſidered, with what chriſtian modestie I may ſo often, and that in print mooue queſtion of things to his diſcredite, which her maieſties most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counſell</hi>

Aſſuredly, if the ſtrange opinions, and vndutiful behauiour of theſe men, as they are well knowen to the iudges, ſo had bene well knowen to the people; men would neuer haue either admired them or folowed them, or praiſed that diſcipline which they ſeeke for. Neither do I thinke, that there is any order in the Starre chamber to the contrary,
<pb facs="tcp:21141:46"/>Why doeth not <hi>M.

               <p>What cauſe then hath <hi>M.

               <pb facs="tcp:21141:47"/>
               <p>Laſtly, he entreth into compariſon with me, and ſaieth, <hi>bee would be aſhamed to come behind me in any duetie.</hi> wherein it had bene good if he had hired <hi>M. Throk.</hi> or ſome of his friends to ſpeake for him. This domeſticall teſtimonie of himſelfe ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſtrongly of folly and arrogancie, &amp; is litle to be reſpected. yea, albeit his deſerts were greater, yet is the compariſon odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and loth I am to follow <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> in this vanitie. yet thus much I may ſay for my ſelfe: that I neuer was impriſoned for any vndutifull and diſloyall opinions and miſdemeanors, as he hath bene, neither did I euer hide my head in corners as hee hath done: nor did I euer ſo neerely touch her maieſties royall prerogatiue, her reuenues, and her lawes, as <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> did; nor euer haue I written bookes in defence of a new gouernment of the church, nor maintained the ſame directly againſt lawes, as he hath done and doeth. Againe I thinke <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> was neuer employed in her maieſties ſeruice, as I haue bene now this fourth time: yea while I was in her ſeruice in the iorney of Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, hee emploied all his time and labour in ſetting foorth and printing this moſt ſimple briefe. ô what brags would he make, if euer he had done her maieſtie ſeruice, that is not now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to brag of his duetifull behauiour towards her maieſtie, whoſe whole time hath bene emploied in oppugning that ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall gouernment, which by her authoritie is eſtabliſhed! ſo litle doeth he ſhame to looke into the crooked courſe of his whole life and ſtudie.</p>
               <p>For anſwere therefore to this obiection, <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> doth inſinuate, <hi>that all other matters being equall, he is behind me onely in his iudgement in matters of diſcipline.</hi> which is vntrue. for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that iudgement, he might haue done her maieſtie ſeruice, if he had would, as I haue done. Beſide that, this onely dealing of his about his fancifull diſcipline is matter ſufficient to conuict him of notorious miſdemeanors, and vndutiful cariage of himſelfe, as hath bene declared. neither is his defence of any moment, where he ſaieth, that <hi>many are of his opinion.</hi> for in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lewd practiſe there are lightly many conſorts; and heretikes and ſchiſmatikes want no folowers. Beſide that, it is vntrue <hi>that many worthy churches and godly learned of this and other ages are of his opinion.</hi> for before <hi>Caluins</hi> time his diſcipline was neuer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21141:47"/>heard of. and albeit now ſome churches doe embrace his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons herein: yet doe they not conſent with <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> in many points. nor I thinke did they allow any negotiation and practiſe for the eſtabliſhing of his new diſcipline in this land by forging, railing, libelling, and diſloiall dealing. Would therfore <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> doe me this fauour in two other ſheetes of paper to ſhew that godly learned men of other ages were of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that other churches allow his courſes, hee ſhould cleare himſelfe of the ſuſpicion of a great and notorious vntrueth.</p>
               <p>The reſt of <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> anſwere in this place is nothing, but an idle digreſſion nothing pertinent to the clearing of the obiection concerning his iudgement of <hi>Fenners</hi> booke, and the authoritie by him giuen to certeine <hi>Ephori</hi> to ouerrule princes, yet leaſt hee ſhould compleine hee were not anſwered, I am to craue pardon, if I examine this alſo. He ſaith firſt, that although <hi>I dare him not once, but ſundry times to anſwere touching theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſcipline, yet it is not ſo fit for him to vndertake it.</hi> To this I anſwere firſt that albeit I ſhould dare him, yet it is no ſlander to his worſhip that I dare him. it is rather ſhame for him, that hee commeth not forth being dared. Secondly he doth mee wrong to ſay, <hi>I dare him.</hi> for he dare do any thing, yea things very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and vnlawfull. But in deed I doe in diuers points challenge him to mainteine his bolde and raſh aſſertions, and that not to ſtirre contention, but to ſhew that albeit he dare do it, yet he can not mainteine his cauſe. Thirdly I do mainteine, that there is no man that hath more reaſon to anſwere in theſe cauſes then hee. and that firſt, for that he in this Church firſt of all in large books defended theſe opinions. Now why ſhould any bee thought more fit to ſpeake, then hee that firſt made challenge, and entred the liftes in defence of this cauſe? Secondly there is none whom that ſide doth more deſire ſhould anſwere then <hi>M. Cartwright.</hi> Thirdly they imagine that none is more able. Fourthly the cauſe of others is deſerted. Fiftly none promiſed or bragged ſo much as he. Laſtly of all men, I would that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> ſhould ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially anſwere, that when it appeareth, how the patriarch of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline can ſay nothing; his followers that are abuſed, might ſooneſt be mooued to change opinion. And if neither his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries prouocation, nor his friends deſire, nor his owne reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:21141:48"/>nor his cauſe deſerted, nor his owne great words and brags do moue him: I ſee no excuſe he can haue, but the impoſſibilitie of defence, and the vntrueth of matters heretofore defended by him.</p>
               <p>He pretendeth age and forgetfulneſſe, but the firſt is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the ſecond is abſurd. for he ought not to forget his duty, nor what he is to ſay for himſelfe. Hee ſaith alſo, <hi>that others are more able.</hi> but I dare ſay, he beleeueth it not, and his friendes by no meanes will admit it. Therefore when no iuſt excuſe can be alledged of ſilence, he proceedeth ſaying, <hi>that if either his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere might haue allowance of print or paſſage, himſelfe in that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hee is in, would not be behinde to anſwere any thing, that I haue bene able to alledge in theſe matters.</hi> as if hee might not as well print and paſſe his bookes at <hi>Geneua</hi> or <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> as he did his firſt and ſecond replies. Beſide that, if the matters he ſtandeth on be ſuch as he ſaith, then ought he to care for no allowance, nor paſſage. for if diſcipline bee a part of the Goſpell, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to be defended, as that he ought to giue his life for it, yea ſo many liues as he hath haires of his head; theſe are no iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes why he ſhould flie backe. Further, when hee printed his firſt bookes he deſired neither paſſage nor allowance, why then ſhould hee nowe deſire it, more then then? Is his heate of zeale cooled, or is he growne wiſe? nay he ſaith he is growne weake. percaſe he hath taken ſome rheume or cold that hath diſordred the records of his fancie, which is the proper ſeate of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. But this is no allowable excuſe, eſpecially ſeeing he <hi>doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not but to anſwer whatſoeuer I haue bene able to alledge:</hi> for ſo he ſaith. Yet his friendes doe rather looke for performance. For his bragges, I ſay nothing, but as the Poet ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> meaneth not to deale further in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I take this as a preſumption, for that hee doubteth <hi>whether there bee any thing in my writings, which is not anſwered already by thoſe, that haue written in that cauſe.</hi> for that is onely a cloake for his ſluggiſhneſſe, and the weakeneſſe of his conſiſtoriall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. but ſuch a cloake, as beareth out neither wind, raine, nor Sunne. I wonder that he ſhould make ſuch an exception, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21141:48"/>that not without ſome note of a hard forhead and conſcience. For he knoweth that the books I haue writen, whereof one is in Latine, the other in Engliſh, are directly againſt their diſcipline, which argument none to my knowledge euer handled ſeueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and purpoſely either before mee, or after mee. Other bookes that haue bene written in this cauſe are rather for defence of the preſent gouernment, then againſt their newe diſcipline. How then can my bookes be ſaide to be anſwered in other treatiſes, that are rather written to oppugne our gouernment, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend theirs? eſpecially ſeeing in my bookes all theſe arguments are anſwered which here and there others haue written for the new diſcipline. Somewhat I confeſſe hath bene written ſince, but nothing to the purpoſe, nor orderly, nor ſchollerly. As for M. <hi>Beza</hi> it pleaſeth him to raile on me, &amp; giue me euil language which God forgiue him, and I forgiue &amp; forget, but to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he anſwereth nothing. Nay his diſcourſe is ſuch as rather we do pitie the man for his age and weakenes, then value any thing he hath ſaid. and yet both <hi>M. D. Sarauia</hi> hath anſwered him, and ſo haue I, and haue the booke ready to be printed, if any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne but once to ſtirre in the cauſe. Wherefore good <hi>M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> either let me haue publike, or priuate anſwere to content mee, or els leaue of your bragging promiſes. if not, whatſoeuer you ſay, all your folowers will miſlike you, and your aduerſaries take your ſilence for confeſſion.</p>
               <p>In the end of this anſwere of his, he goeth about to prooue, <hi>that his ſilence proceedeth not altogether from inabilitie or feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hauing proceeded to a rude</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">His anſwere conſiſting of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers pieces, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by diuers of the fraternity in Cambridge, knowen to be of ſmall ſufficiency, he hath no ſuch cauſe to tell vs of his great labours taken, &amp; learning ſhewed therein.</note> 
                  <hi>draught of an anſwere to a great part of the Ieſuiticall annotations vpon the New teſtament</hi> (of which hee maketh a great bragge) <hi>yet being countermanded he did not publiſh them, nor</hi> (as he ſayth in the margent) <hi>vſeth haſtily to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any thing, howſoeuer he might be perſuaded of the trueth of it.</hi> but of all others, this reaſon is moſt ſimple and leaſt concludent. for the caſe is farre different betwixt the publication of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Rhemiſh annotations, (which I know not why he calleth Ieſuiticall, or his anſwere, being pieced together by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other) and this expected defence of diſcipline. for that was neuer expected at his hands, nor promiſed, nor could without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers helpe be performed: this was both much expected, and in
<pb facs="tcp:21141:49"/>his firſt replies in effect promiſed, and this he thought himſelfe once able to performe. beſide that, all his partakers deſired his defence of the new diſcipline, which they expected would be a worke very compleat, and the rather they deſired it, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abandoned the cauſe. but his anſwere to the Rhemiſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, wrought out in the monaſterie of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> for the moſt part very rudely, beſide his owne followers, none expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp; ſome wiſe men thought meet ſhould be ſtopped, both for the diſcordance of the parts, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his ſimple dealing in many points, eſpecially concerning diſcipline, he betrayed our cauſe, and did giue more aduantage to the aduerſary, then all his ſide would haue done good. and laſtly for that M. D. <hi>Fulke</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſufficiently and learnedly before him had dealt in the cauſe. neither doth any well aduiſed man thinke it expedient, that he ſhould deale in the publike cauſe, vnleſſe his writings might be publikly reuiewed before they were printed, which his haughtie ſpirit could by no meanes endure. the which appeareth by his wordes in this place. for albeit ſome part of the preface to his booke was brought to thoſe that had authority to peruſe it, yet he ſignifieth <hi>that if he could haue choſen, it ſhould neuer haue come to their hands.</hi> it was not therefore his moderation, that ſtayd the printing (for he confeſſeth that ſome parts were already going to the preſſe) but the inſufficiency of his worke, and the authors pride, that would admit no correction; and laſtly, for that D. <hi>Fulke</hi> of bleſſed memory, a man more iudicious, and learned, then he, had trauailed therein more ſufficiently, and perfectly before him. and thus much by the way to take away his friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excuſes of his ſilence in the cauſe of diſcipline, in which firſt he was ſo fiery and furious.

<pb facs="tcp:21141:50"/>of theſe, how can it be thought that euer hee miſliked that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould be ſo vnchriſtianly, &amp; conſiſtorianly dealt withall?</p>

               <p>The beginning of M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> anſwere to this charge, hath no ſenſe to be picked out of it: which I take to be the correctours fault, and ſo let it paſſe. his meaning is, <hi>that I can not ſhew either in his reply or other treatiſe of his, that he hath ſo litle knowledge in diuinity, as to ſay that the extemporall prayers of any in theſe dayes are vttered by the holy Ghoſts ſecret inſpiration.</hi> wherein he doth himſelfe wrong to call his knowledge of diuinitie in queſtion. for to ſay what I finde, if he approue M. <hi>Fenners</hi> booke ſo farre as his epiſtle commendatory pretendeth; his skill in diuinitie is nothing ſingular. the ſame doth appeare by ſtrange points hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in his replies. but better ſhould I iudge, if leauing his buſie kinde of dealing againſt the ſtate, hee had written any booke concerning points of faith. Yea in this very point in hand I do wonder how he hath here ſlipped. for being charged by me for better liking of extemporall prayers then any preſcript forme of prayers, as is true indeed, and ſhall be verified againſt him: here very ignorantly he falleth into the contrary errour, and ſayth, <hi>hee is not ſo ignorant of diuinity, as to affirme that the extemporall prayers of any in theſe dayes are vttered by the holy Ghosts ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</hi> which is to deny the working of the holy Ghoſt in the prayers of the godly, and to contrary the holy apoſtle, which<note n="1" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> ſayth, <hi>that the holy Ghoſt helpeth our infirmities when we know not what to pray, as wee ought.</hi> and if our prayers were not ayded by Gods holy ſpirit, they would not pleaſe God. ſo that to charge him herewith; is no ſlander, nor if I ſhould ſo ſay, is it criminall to ſay, <hi>that extemporall prayers of godly men deuoutly and diſcreetly conceiued are vttered by the inward motions of Gods holy ſpirit</hi> inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them. but indeed I do not charge him herewith, but ſay, <hi>that</hi> M. Cartwr. <hi>doth commend extemporall prayers, as vttered by the holy Ghoſts ſecret inſpiration.</hi> which is true. for whereas the authours of the admonition do<note n="2" place="margin">Admonit, to the Parliam.</note> ſay, <hi>that in the time of the apoſtles the miniſter spowred forth hearty ſupplications to the Lord, as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moued them;</hi> M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> doth take on him the defence of this admonition. beſide that for my part I neuer heard M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> refuſe to vſe extemporall prayers. and I doubtnot, but he thought he prayed by the motion or aſſiſtauce of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. yea and all the brotherhood, as they are miſtermed, doeth vſe long extemporall prayers both before meat and after meat,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21141:51"/>eſpecially at great feaſts; for then they make longeſt prayers, now they doubt not, but they pray as the ſpirit giueth them vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance. although indeed ſome of their ſpeaks do rather ſauour of the pot, then of any goodneſſe, finally, all the Baroiſts vpon theſe foundations, and the common practiſe of extemporall prayers, haue condemned all preſcript formes of prayer, which declareth that they vnderſtood M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> as I do.</p>
               <p>Secondly he asketh me, <hi>in what time &amp; place, and in whoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he could ſcarcely be induced to like of a preſcript forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that if theſe circumſtances had bene ſet downe, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of my allegation would haue appeared. and that his continuall practiſe in the miniſtery doth witneſſe against me.</hi> Wherein I cannot chuſe but wonder that hee ſhould ſo much forget himſelfe, and wilfully abuſe his reader. For firſt he may remember, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition which he taketh on him to defend doth holde, <hi>that in the primitiue Church the miniſters were not tyed to any forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers inuented by man.</hi> And that my L. of Canterbury refuting this error, he goeth about to<note n="1" place="margin">1. reply p. 106.</note> anſwere his reaſons, and yeeldeth not till afterward; ſo that it appeareth he was not eaſily induced. he may alſo remember, <hi>that hee would</hi>

                  <hi>haue all Apoſtolicall orders now receiued and vſed.</hi> Beſide that, his continual practiſe is to vſe no preſcript forme of prayers, but ſuch as himſelfe deuiſeth, and ſo do the whole race of theſe ſectaries, yea and ſo often times haue they bene heard to commend extemporall formes, and to diſlike preſcript formes, that I wonder how it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that <hi>M.

                  <note n="3" place="margin">A weake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. for his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes according to his opinion, and doctrine. He was wont to ſpeake againſt diſpenſations, and <hi>non reſidence;</hi> and yet now is <hi>non reſident</hi> from his charge, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, as they ſay.</note> 
                  <hi>practiſe in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie doth witneſſe againſt it.</hi> a matter notoriouſly vntrue. For as long as he was in Cambridge, hee prayed as it pleaſed himſelfe, and vſed formes by himſelfe deuiſed. And ſo like wiſe doe all his followers, and thoſe haue I heard moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching continually, yet euery day vſed new formes. And albeit <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> did read prayers at <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Middleborough</hi> out of the booke, as hee ſaith, yet that doth not ſhew that thoſe prayers were preſcribed to him. neither were his formes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at Warwike ſuch as this Church of England preſcribed, but ſuch as himſelfe deuiſed. Yea although he ſaid the Lords prayer, yet in that ſort it was not to him preſcribed, as he ſaid it. I beſeech
<pb facs="tcp:21141:52"/>you therefore iudge what a hainous ſlander this is to ſay, <hi>that</hi> M. Cartwright <hi>ſcarce could bee induced when time was to like of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forme of prayer,</hi> when hee is not able to ſhew that either by doctrine or example he approued prayers publikely preſcribed, nor would euer ſuffer himſelfe to bee tyed to the orders of the Church of England. And thus much is ſufficient for anſwere of his ſlanders ſuppoſed to be publiſhed by me againſt him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning breach of neceſſary duties. Wherein it may clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that either hee doeth lewdly collect that which was not meant, or ſeeke to ſhunne that, which cannot bee auoyded. Did you euer before this heare of a man ſo ſlandred with trueth, and matters not criminall? but belike the man was podagricall, and cried before we came neere him.</p>
               <p>Now wee are to proceed to examine his ſecond branch of ſlanders concerning matters indifferent, the which is as ſtrange as the other. ſo ſtrange are they both, that in no good authour I euer read the like. But before we beginne; a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that wrong that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> thinketh to be done to him being charged, as he ſaith, with odious rayling. which yet I truſt hee will not count ſlander, both for that it is left out of his diuiſion, and for that it is moſt euident, and true. That he raileth vnciuily theſe particulers teſtifie. his aduerſaries he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth <hi>to dogs &amp; gheeſe.</hi> the miniſtery of England he calleth <hi>rouing,</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries learned workes he calleth <hi>dung.</hi> the Biſhops he calleth Popiſh &amp; antichriſtian. Me he doth charge with vnchriſtian and immodeſt dealing, &amp; ſuffreth his friend in the preface to cry out with full mouth againſt me. Infinite are his flowers in this kind. which I doubt not in euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s accompt are odious, yet ſhould I do him wrong to call it <hi>ignorant,</hi> the man hauing ſo good skill and ſo excellent a veine herein. onely let him not vſe it to much, nor bragge of it. For the more skill he ſheweth herein, the leſſe commendation he ſhall deſerue. odious railing, and Chriſtian diſcretion hardly meete together in one man. But let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the reſt.</p>

               <p>I will not deny, but there might be ſome miſtaking in him that brought mee this report of <hi>M. Cartwrights</hi> dealing in the execution of <hi>M. Stubbes</hi> his will. for, as <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> affirmeth, and by peruſing his will I finde, his brother did not ſo farre truſt him. But aſſuredly my purpoſe was not to wrong him. neither to my knowledge haue I done it, were all true that <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> ſaith, which not withſtanding I am not bound to beleeue. For I
<pb facs="tcp:21141:53"/>do not<note n="1" place="margin">Anſwere to the petit. p. 8. &amp; 9.</note> ſay, as <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> vntruly affirmeth, <hi>that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be executour to his brothers</hi> Stubbe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <hi>his will,</hi> but that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not the execution of his will. And that was not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to me, but beleeued, for that common humanitie and the office of a kinſman and brother required it at his handes, and for that in truth M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> confeſleth, that there were dealings that paſſed betwixt him and his brother in truſt. But bee it, that he was either not ſo greedy as to deſire, or ſo inhumane and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde as to refuſe in part to execute his brothers will going in his countreys ſeruice, and hauing none neerer to him then M. <hi>Cartwright;</hi> what ſlander is this? Is it a diſhoneſt part to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his brothers will? nay it is a rude and inhumane part to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do it. But may not miniſters deale therein? yes: and as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men as M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> too. neither doth <hi>Cyprians</hi> caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our times. Why then ſhould this bee a ſlander? forſooth (percaſe) becauſe he hath taught, that miniſters may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of willes, nor deale in ciuil cauſes. and therfore he would be loth to deale in matters of willes. Why then doth he deale in ciuil cauſes? why doth he deale in leaſes, in money, in lands, and all thoſe things that executors deale in? why is he ſtill maſter of an Hoſpitall? and if to charge him in this bee no ſlander, ſure no ſlander it is to charge him in the other. Vntruth it may bee, but certes no ſlander. What then if neither it be vntrueth, nor ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? hath M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> any cauſe to complaine? aſſuredly for ought M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> hath ſaid as yet, there is not any vntruth in any words to be found. For if ſo be M. <hi>Stubbes</hi> did neuer offer it, nor name M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> his executor, then true it is which I ſay, <hi>that he refuſed it not.</hi> And why? becauſe it was neuer either offered or meant. But becauſe indeed I ſuppoſed there had bene ſome intendement in M. <hi>Stubbes</hi> to put truſt in him, it ſhall bee ſhewed that in that ſence he hath not refuted my words.</p>
               <p>He ſaith firſt, <hi>that he was not named in his brothers will.</hi> Admit it were ſo. yet diuers doe adminiſter goods, that are not named in the teſtators will: thoſe eſpecially that haue truſt put in them. Beſide that, he doth not deny, but he might be named in the ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule mentioned in the will, and which is a part of the ſame. Thirdly he confeſſeth that he yeelded vp a leaſe worth 6. pound yeerely aboue all repriſe for nothing, and his annuitie for the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21141:53"/>ſumme his brother had of him: which declareth, that this was a matter of truſt. for I doe not beleeue, that M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was ſo tender hearted, as to giue a way his things for litle or nothing. Fourthly why ſhould miſtreſſe <hi>Stubbes</hi> &amp; her friends complaine of M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> if nothing was put to his truſt? that her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint ſhould be cauſeleſſe, is ridiculous. that ſhe complained, his conſcience well knoweth, and it ſhall be verified if he will. but ſeeing he will needes ſhew himſelfe ſo vnkinde, as to abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his brothers laſt requeſtes, and ſo inhumane as not to ſee his brothers laſt will executed, be it ſo: and let this be put among the vnciuill and vnnaturall rules of puritaniſine. yet if he deale in the buſineſſe of his hoſpitall according to my lord of Leiceſters or my lord of Warwikes laſt will, I doubt not, but he will proue an executor of a will. but forſooth he will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any mans wil, but great lords. howſoeuer it is; my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which in my anſwere to the petition I made againſt M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his diſcipline ſtandeth firme. for if M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> deale in the gouernment of his hoſpitall, and other ciuill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his owne; albeit hee take himſelfe to be a miniſter of the worde; then either hee doeth againſt his owne rule, or els hath no reaſon to exclude miniſters from dealing in ciuill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. but it appeareth he dealeth in ciuill cauſes, yea and that as may by his owne ſimple tale be preſumed, very hardly. for if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his annuity and writing for it, hee had a leaſe woorth 6. <hi>li.</hi> yerely for one peppercorne, it appeareth that hard dealing in his conſcience weigheth not ſo much as one pepper come, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he meant to take the aduantage.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.

Theſe three points therefore doe reſt orderly to be diſcuſſed. To the firſt I ſay, that I do not charge him to haue purchaſed 3. or 4. Lordſhips. why doth not he that ſo boldly auoucheth this of me, and pleadeth ſo long againſt me for it, ſet downe my wordes or note the place where they are to be found? Is he determined ſtill to vſe ſuch peruerſe and ſtrange dealing? In deed I confeſſe that I asked a queſtion of <hi>Tho. Cart.</hi> how a man might by ſelling a coat and a few acres of land buy 3. or 4. lordſhips. But euery one that asketh a queſtion eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in matter of fact, and concerning other mens dealings doeth not affirme ſo much as hee maketh a queſtion of, for then were queſtions and affirmations all one, and it were vnlawfull to aske queſtion in any doubtful cauſe. And then ſhould the petitioner and other of <hi>M. Cartwr.</hi> conſorts that haue made many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of very odious matters, affirme the ſame. which were a point very dangerous not only to the authors of the booke, but to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21141:55"/>whole Puritan faction, that ſo well liked it.</p>
               <p>The petitioner doth aske <hi>whether men ought to incurre penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for opinions they helde doubtingly.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> yet it is hereſie to doubt of matters of faith, and diſloyaltie to doubt of the princes title and right to the crowne. So that I truſt he wil not affirme, ſo much as is conteined in his queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>whether the forme of prayers and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Sacraments, the attire of miniſters, and other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of England are more agreeing to the Church of Rome, or the Apoſtles and primitiue order.</hi> I truſt <hi>M.

               <p>He asketh of me <hi>why</hi> M. Cartwr. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>10</label> 
                  <hi>may not ſell the landes he had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his father, and buy other with the money, as well as ſome of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp;c.</hi> Yet he is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as if hee ſaid, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſel their fathers lands, &amp; buy others. For few of them buy, whatſoeuer they ſell, and few may bee compared herein to M. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and his fellowes. who vnder pretence of refuſing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings haue by begging, and whining, and ſhifting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleyning of perſecution enriched themſelues &amp; their children: while Biſhops haue hardly bin able to beare the charge of their office and place.</p>

                  <hi>of Canterbury ſhould not rather be called Popes, then Primates.</hi> yet I truſt hee will not affirme it. he hath a litle more honeſtie, as I thinke.</p>
               <p>He asketh further, <hi>whether Chriſt being before the Biſhops,</hi>

               <p>An other queſtion is likewiſe demaunded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>22</label> 
                  <hi>whether ordinaries haue not contriued, promulgated, and publiſhed articles</hi> (hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth orders) <hi>in their owne name, without her Maieſties aſſent.</hi> yet I doubt, whether he wil ſtand to affirme ſo much.</p>
               <p>He asketh whether <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Iudges are not in the Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>27. &amp; 34.</label> yet dare he not auouch it.</p>
               <p>Like wiſe the diſtracted Abſtractor doth frame many odious interrogatories, which albeit he be, as they ſay, a mad felow, yet he will not affirme, neither I hope wil M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> make affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb facs="tcp:21141:56"/>of them. Hee asketh <hi>whether the Biſhops haue not made vnle arned and criminous miniſters,</hi> and <hi>ſuffered them to continue all her Maieſties reigne.</hi> And, <hi>whether the Archbiſhop haue not dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed contrary to Gods word,</hi> and may <hi>exerciſe abſolute authoritie,</hi> and whether <hi>the Archbiſhop being an excommunicate and ſimonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſon may reſort to the Pope for abſolution.</hi> Yet I thinke the man hath more ſhame and modeſtie then to affirme any ſuch matter. Is it not then a matter very ridiculous, that M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> will haue queſtions to be affirmations? Beſide that, it is very dangerous to his faction, that hath moued ſo many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous queſtions. but to affirme that a queſtion doth more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auow then an affirmation, as doth M. <hi>Cartwr.</hi> is moſt ſtrange and abſurd. Neither doe I ſo reaſon againſt the petitioner, as if euery word of his queſtions were by him auerred and affirmed, but firſt becauſe his queſtions are for the moſt part grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters of Law, of which euery one is to take notice; Next for that he doth not onely make a queſtion, but alſo declare his owne opinion. As for example, one of his queſtions is this.</p>

The firſt appeareth by theſe particulers. he confeſſeth that he hath bought the mannor of Saxemundeham, the moity whereof is worth about 30. <hi>li.</hi> yeerely. now hee knoweth there be diuers mannors that are not 5. <hi>li.</hi> rent. Secondly he cannot deny, but he with one <hi>Fludde</hi> had two leaſes of M. <hi>Morgan</hi> worth 200. markes, as both M. <hi>Fludde</hi> and M. <hi>Morgan</hi> and others wil iuſtifie. He had alſo his brothers lands tied for his annuitie, which ſince that he hath ſold as is ſaid for a great ſumme. Let him therefore tell vs what he hath done with his money and al that he hath gotten ſince. for either muſt it be employed in lands, or leaſes, or ſome trade, or els at vſe. but this he denſeth, and I thinke he vſeth no trade, and therfore that remaineth. Beſide that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> hath large contributions, and gifts, and cannot chuſe but win well by his Hoſpitall. What is then become of all he hath gotten? Hath he ſpent it in almes? he is none of thoſe that meaneth to merit by almes deeds. Hath he ſpent it in hoſpitalitie? nay he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly feedeth at other mens trenchers. Doth he ſpend it in ſeruants? he keepeth few or none, and that the rather to moue men to giue largely. His apparell is not coſtly. At London he ſpendeth nothing in Innes. What then remaineth, but that his money ſhould goe to encreaſe his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues? for I know none ſo vncharitable as to thinke that he hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his talents in a napkin.</p>
               <p>But ſaith he, <hi>he hath gained litle by the Hospitall, ſaue trauel and charge. for the Hospitall oweth him fourtie markes.</hi> as if it were not an eaſie matter to gaine well, and by clayming large allowances when he ſpent litle to make the Hoſpitall indebted to him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he ſaith, <hi>that he hath ſold away the two leaſes in Welborne and his annuitie.</hi> as if ſo be he had not money for them. and I truſt his conſcience would not ſuffer him to be a looſer by them. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing payd 420. <hi>li.</hi> for <hi>Morgans</hi> leaſes, he and his felow had 600. pound againe. a ſmall gaine when you deale with men of good cleane conſciences.</p>
               <p>Further he ſaith, <hi>that he hath no lands in Norfolke nor Warwik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> yet in the ſection next before hee confeſſeth, that hee had lands of his brother <hi>Stubbes</hi> bound for his annuitie, and who wil beleeue, but that he hath employed the money that came of the annuitie and leaſes that he ſolde, or els hath ſome others to do it

Cartwright</hi> ſaith <hi>that in a certeme booke</hi> (he knoweth not where) <hi>I promiſe to bee a ſurueyor or auditor of his and others lands.</hi> but vnleſſe he can ſhew the place, we muſt record it as vntruth. And in the meane while we take him for a man that ſpeaketh he knoweth not what, and that is written he remembreth not where.</p>
               <p>By this which is confeſſed, and I haue learned, it appeareth that if I had ſaid, <hi>that his reuenues are more then ſome</hi> 3. <hi>or</hi> 4. <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> yet the vntrueth had not bene ſuch as is pretended. for you ſee what is confeſſed, and what is more, euery man may conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. But in deede I doe not ſay ſo much, but doubting of the matter, becauſe of the vncerteintie of mens reports, I only asked the queſtion, wondering in deede, how of ſo litle beginnings he could ariſe to ſuch wealth, and not beleeuing, that ſuch a ſimple ferme as Waddon is, and the fermes are in that countrey (albeit the number of acres were ſo great, as he affirmeth, and I doe not beleeue) and which (I doubt not) was ſpentmoſt during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in Cambridge, and in his trauel, could be ſold for a fift part of that money, which now he is worth in lands and goods.</p>
               <p>I need not therefore to make an excuſe, as being herein abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by others; neither did I: although M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly ſayth, I did ſo. and therefore referreth it to iudgement <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how it ſtandeth with my credit to report whatſoeuer I he are by report.</hi> to whom I anſwere, that this maketh little for his credit to ſpeake vntruth, and to forge matters neuer ſaid, nor thought. let him ſhew firſt where I excuſe my ſelfe by report. next where I report whatfoeuer I heare of others. and laſtly, that theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt him ſtand vpon report onely; and are vtterly falſe. if not, then whether he be miniſter or not (which iuſtly may be doubted) he muſt vnderſtand, that hee hath done me wrong. and if hee be a miniſter, that hee hath taught falſly, and charged me vntruly, and is farre more at eaſe then his fellow miniſters, which hath gotten ſo great wealth, and is at ſo litle charge.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond point of his charge I aunſwere, that I neuer ſayd, that he hath gotten three or foure mannours by the ſpoile of his hoſpitall. why then doth hee charge me with ſo ſaying?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21141:58"/>is this the ſincerity of the doctours of diſcipline to exclaime vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men for ſlanders, and yet not to be able to ſhew any good matter, but ſuch as they forge themſelues? that I neuer ſayd ſo, what proof need I, but that he doth not in one word go about to anſwere any ſuch thing? Beſide this looke my books, there will no ſuch matter bee found. Indeede I may ſay that the ſtipend of his Hoſpitall being toward 50. <hi>li.</hi> is a good helpe to him, and I ſay <hi>that the lawe preſumeth that hee hath gotten moſt part of his wealth by his Hospitall.</hi> and that is true, as appeareth by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of<note n="1" place="margin">c. Inquirendum de peculio cleric.</note> 
                  <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and<note n="2" place="margin">c. ſi quu ſane. codem.</note>

But now that ſimple fooles do ceaſe offering to this ſaints ſhrine, and that the idolatrie and ſuperſtition thereof is diſcouered, it ſeemeth, he is much offended.</p>
               <p>The third point is eaſily cleared. for if he were neuer charged with ſpoyling his Hoſpitall, as himſelfe afraide of ſome ſhadow that troubleth his conſcience doth ſurmiſe: how can he be ſaid to be therein ſlandered? That in his purchaſes he is not ſlandred, it doth appeare by that which is ſaid before.</p>
               <p>And this may bee ynough, and percaſe to much for my clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring touching this matter. for what perteineth it to me, what <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> hath purchaſed, and how? onely thus much it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for the cauſe, that <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> hauing atteined to ſo great wealth and liuing, by what meanes fewe men know; hee hath no reaſon to compleine of perſecution, or to exclaime and cry out againſt the liuings of the clergie, and to offer them as it were a praye to thoſe rauinors, that would helpe to aduance his ſtrange nouelties. Neither (I thinke) wil he do ſo any more, nay now he hath much a doe to hide what he hath gotten himſelfe, and would gladly if he might goe cleare away with it: and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well doe it, vnleſſe we beleeue his bare word, which is leſſe then a bare report, which notwithſtanding hee little eſteemeth. That he cannot thus clearely cary away the matter, his owne ſuſpicious anſwere ſheweth. he doth not tell vs when he ſolde his fathers ferme, nor what he had for it. neither dare he declare what he paid for Saxemundham mannor, nor whether M. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21141:59"/>that enioyeth the moity of the demaines payd him any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. He doeth likewiſe concele from vs, what money M. <hi>Stubbes</hi> had for his annuitie, and what the money was he ought him. Likewiſe he telleth vs not, what he gaue with his daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> nor what he meaneth to giue with his other daughters. He doeth not tell vs what M. <hi>Morgan</hi> had of him for his leaſes, nor what money hee had backe from M. <hi>Morgan.</hi> neither doth he ſet downe his ſtipend of his Hoſpitall, nor what money hee hath leant to M. <hi>I. Throkmorton,</hi> nor what corne, or other things hee hath had of him; nor any particulers whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that all his wealth may riſe out of his fathers ferme, his wiues portion, and his Hoſpital. Nor dare he ſhew what ſheepe and cattell he hath, nor what his wife hath got by making mair. who can therefore beleeue otherwiſe, then that hee hath more then he dare make ſhew of, or that he hath leſſe, then I ſuppoſed hee had? if hee will yet ſay otherwiſe, then let him anſwere to theſe points directly, and I will my ſelfe acquite him, if hee can diſcharge himſelfe.

<pb facs="tcp:21141:60"/>intereſt, that is in all contracts ſo much as concerneth a mans profit or loſſe, from vſury that is in lone of money: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, allowing vſury contrary to all diuinity, law, and reaſon. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his exception auaile him. for vuleſſe charity be in<note n="1" place="margin">Quid foeuerari? quid hom ine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidere?

                  </note> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of throats, charity is not in vſury, but in lending freely. the note doeth teſtifie that he forbore his money ſo iuſtly two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths which merchants in their exchanges obſerue, that hee is vehemently to be ſuſpected for receiuing double vſance, M. <hi>Morgan</hi> much complained, that he was eaten vp with vſurie. and M. <hi>Michell,</hi> if he were called vpon his othe, would ſay this money of M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> did him no good.</p>
               <p>Beſides vſury there appeare diuers bad practiſes in M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi> dealings. firſt it is no ſigne of honeſt meaning, to make bonds to a third perſon, it argueth that he meant to haue that, which he was aſhamed to take. beſides it is no good courſe to entangle yong men in bonds, their fathers being yet liuing. the<note n="2" place="margin">l. <hi>1.</hi> ff. deſ. C.

               <p>But ſayeth hee, <hi>what vſe I can make of money, appeareth by the leaſe of</hi> M. Morgan.<note n="3" place="margin">In the written copy which M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gaue out, it is 14. <hi>li.</hi> 10.5. but becauſe it is too much to take ſo much for 100. <hi>li.</hi> hee taketh his penne, ſetting down 12. <hi>li.</hi> 10. s. confuting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his owne hand, &amp; making no conſcience to tell vntrueth, and therefore his bare word is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt, it is but bare proofe.</note> true. for M. <hi>Morgan</hi> did grealy complaine of your hard dealing, the ſame alſo appeareth by the note made to M. <hi>Michell,</hi> yea and by the mans teſtimony. but nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſame more euident, then the dealing with M. <hi>Stubs,</hi> for to take an annuity of 12. <hi>li.</hi> 10. s. yerely for one hundred pound (as it ſeemed you did, and muſt confeſſe, if you will tell what money he had of you) and afterward to releaſe the annuity for an hundred pound, is nothing but to take 12. <hi>li.</hi> 10. s. yerely for the vſe of an hundred pound. Likewiſe he that deliuereth out two or three hundred pound, or ſuch a ſumme of money vpon a leaſe, and afterward releaſeth his bargaine for his money again, and percaſe halfe ſo much more, cannot eſcape the note of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vſurer. how nere this was to M. <hi>Morgans</hi> caſe, I report me to M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> conſcience, and M. <hi>Fluddes</hi> and <hi>Morgans</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21141:60"/>which muſt needes teſtifie that for 420. <hi>li.</hi> they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued 600. <hi>li.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſayth further, <hi>that the recognizance</hi> wherein M. <hi>Michell</hi> ſtood bound to his friend was but for 200. <hi>li.</hi> yet the copy of the note which was vnder M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> hand doth mention 300. li. but M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> hath gotten the originall into his handes, and ſo preſumeth to ſay what he liſt. but firſt the writer ſhall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt him, and next his owne conſcience. but ſayth he, <hi>let him ſhew me the note, thereby either to ſhame him, or my ſelfe.</hi> and in the margent it is ſayd, <hi>that I am put to the iumpe of a piece of my credit.</hi> as if it were not ſufficient that there was ſuch a note. or as if my credit depended on ſuch patched notes. will M. <hi>Cartw.</hi> ſay on his credit that there neuer was ſuch a note, and that it was only for 200. <hi>li.</hi> he will not, I am aſſured, &amp; therefore what need ſolemne proofes where the matter in queſtion cannot be denied?</p>
               <p>He alledgeth alſo, that he cannot yet haue his money of M. <hi>Michell,</hi> which is the caſe of many that lend for intereſt, and abridgeth the ſuſpition of vſury nothing. Laſtly, to ſhewe his good dealing, he ſayth, <hi>he had nothing for his money, but what his friends voluntarily gaue.</hi> but that hee doeth not ſpecifie, neither doth hee ſhew whether he expected the ſame or not. which if he did would conuince him of mentall vſurie, all this defence therefore is defectiue. for neither doth he alledge matter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his diſcharge, nor bringeth any other proofe, then his owne ſingle and bare word, which I beleeue no more, then I beleeue M. <hi>Throk.</hi> word if he ſhould be examined at the barre, and pleade not guilty. he that is charged can doe no leſſe then deny, but where be his witneſſes? where be the proofes?</p>
               <p>Thus you haue heard M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> defence of himſelfe in matters needleſſe, if he could haue contented himſelfe; wherein albeit he would blot others, and cleare himſelfe, yet all falleth out againſt him, and maketh for his aduerſary, it may be M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> will thinke otherwiſe, and reply, but if he purpoſe to ſalue his credit, let him no more forge and deuiſe matters on his owne head, and as hee pleaſeth himſelfe, but let him deale plainly, and ſet downe my wordes as I wrote them, not as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wreſteth them, and then I doubt not, but his owne eyes
<pb facs="tcp:21141:61"/>will ſee, and his owne confcience condemne his owne errours. all the worſt I deſire him is, that he may ſee them, acknowledge them, and amend them, if he will not amend them, yet let him make an end of theſe fooliſh challenges, that will be accepted, (he may aſſure himſelfe) much to his hurt, and preiudice. if he will make no end of quarrelling, let him not complaine, if his follies be layd open to the world. and if he will needs write, let him leaue theſe trifling controuerſies, and employ his wit, and labour in the common cauſe. if he will both quarrell and trifle; I can not for my part, but be ſory to deale with ſo quarrelſome and trifling an aduerſary: and his friends lament, that he hath fallen on ſuch a baſe and worthleſſe argument. only <hi>I. Throkm.</hi> percaſe will take pleaſure in theſe courſes, and furniſh him with ſtore of prefaces, ſuch as is ſet before this briefe: but he had better conſult with wifer heades, and take an other courſe. it may be hee will not heare me: I will therefore forbeare to vrge him further, &amp; commend him to God, and leaue him to the counſell of his beſt friendes.</p>
